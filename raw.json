{"ned": " Aye."},
{"robert": " Don\u2019t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn\u2019t listen.  I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you\u2019re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."},
{"ned": " I\u2019m not worthy of the honor."},
{"robert": " I\u2019m not trying to honor you. I\u2019m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it\u2019s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We\u2019ll join our Houses."},

{"ros": " M\u2019lord."},

{"jaime": " You\u2019ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."},
{"tyrion": " She has odd cravings, our sister."},
{"jaime": " A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don\u2019t leave me alone with these people."},
{"tyrion": " I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."},
{"jaime": " I thought you might say that. But since we\u2019re short on time,  Come on, girls. See you at sundown."},
{"tyrion": " Close the door!"},
{"robert": " Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her."},
{"ned": " She was my sister. This is where she belongs."},
{"robert": " She belonged with me."},
{"robert": " In my dreams, I kill him every night."},
{"ned": " It\u2019s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."},
{"robert": " Not all of them."},
{"viserys": " Daenerys!"},
{"viserys": " Daenerys! There\u2019s our bride to be! Look \u2013 a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn\u2019t he a gracious host?"},
{"daenerys": " We\u2019ve been his guests for over a year and he\u2019s never asked us for anything."},
{"viserys": " Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won\u2019t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see.  You have a woman\u2019s body now.  I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don\u2019t want to wake the dragon, do you?"},
{"daenerys": " No."},
{"viserys": " When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."},
{"maid": " It\u2019s too hot, my lady."},
{"viserys": " Where is he?"},
{"illyrio": " The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality."},
{"illyrio": "  May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."},
{"illyrio": " Come forward, my dear."},
{"viserys": " Where\u2019s he going?"},
{"illyrio": " The ceremony is over."},
{"viserys": " But he didn\u2019t say anything. Did he like her?"},
{"illyrio": " Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn\u2019t like her, we\u2019d know."},
{"illyrio": " It won\u2019t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father\u2019s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king."},
{"viserys": " When will they be married?"},
{"illyrio": " Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long."},
{"viserys": " Is it true they lie with their horses?"},
{"illyrio": " I wouldn\u2019t ask Khal Drogo."},
{"viserys": " Do you take me for a fool?"},
{"illyrio": " I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I\u2019ve given offense."},
{"viserys": " I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army."},
{"viserys": " So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"},
{"daenerys": " I don\u2019t know."},
{"viserys": " We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo\u2019s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that\u2019s what it took."},
{"sansa": " Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I\u2019m ugly?"},
{"catelyn": " Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived."},
{"sansa": " He\u2019s so handsome."},
{"sansa": " When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?"},
{"catelyn": " Hush now. Your father hasn\u2019t even said yes."},
{"sansa": " Why would he say no? He\u2019d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms."},
{"catelyn": " He\u2019d have to leave home. He\u2019d have to leave me. And so would you."},
{"sansa": " You left your home to come here. And I\u2019d be queen someday. Please make father say yes."},
{"catelyn": " Sansa\u2026"},
{"sansa": " Please, please. It\u2019s the only thing I ever wanted."},
{"benjen": " Is he dead yet?"},
{"jon": " Uncle Benjen!"},
{"benjen": " You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn\u2019t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren\u2019t you at the feast?"},
{"jon": " Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst."},
{"benjen": " Well, you\u2019re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."},
{"jon": " So take me with you when you go back."},
{"benjen": " Jon\u2026"},
{"jon": " Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."},
{"benjen": " The Wall isn\u2019t going anywhere."},
{"jon": " I\u2019m ready to swear your oath."},
{"benjen": " You don\u2019t understand what you\u2019d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons."},
{"jon": " I don\u2019t care about that."},
{"benjen": " You might, if you knew what it meant. \u2026 I\u2019d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We\u2019ll talk later."},
{"tyrion": " Your uncle\u2019s in the Night\u2019s Watch."},
{"jon": " What\u2019re you doing back there?"},
{"tyrion": " Preparing for a night with your family. I\u2019ve always wanted to see the Wall."},
{"jon": " You\u2019re Tyrion Lannister. The queen\u2019s brother?"},
{"tyrion": " My greatest accomplishment. You \u2013 you\u2019re Ned Stark\u2019s bastard, aren\u2019t you?"},
{"tyrion": " Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."},
{"jon": " Lord Eddard Stark is my father."},
{"tyrion": " And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."},
{"jon": " What the hell do you know about being a bastard?"},
{"tyrion": " All dwarves are bastards in their fathers\u2019 eyes."},
{"benjen": " You at a feast -- It\u2019s like a bear in a trap."},
{"ned": " The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?"},
{"benjen": " Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."},
{"ned": " He was talking madness. Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends."},
{"benjen": " The two he was with are still missing."},
{"ned": " A wildling ambush."},
{"benjen": " Maybe. Direwolves south of the wall. Talk of the Walkers. My brother might be the next Hand to the king. Winter is coming."},
{"ned": " Winter is coming."},
{"robb": " Uncle Benjen."},
{"benjen": " Robb boy. How are ye?"},
{"robb": " I\u2019m good."},
{"cersei": " Yes. Lovely country."},
{"catelyn": " I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very grim, after Kings Landing. I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time."},
{"cersei": " Hello, little dove. But you are a beauty. How old are you?"},
{"sansa": " Thirteen, Your Grace."},
{"cersei": " You\u2019re tall. Still growing?"},
{"sansa": " I think so, Your Grace."},
{"cersei": " And have you bled yet?"},
{"sansa": " No, Your Grace."},
{"cersei": " And your dress. Did you make it?"},
{"cersei": " Such talent. You must make something for me."},
{"cersei (to catelyn]": " I hear we might share a grandchild someday."},
{"catelyn": " I hear the same."},
{"cersei": " Your daughter will do well in the capital. Such a beauty shouldn\u2019t stay hidden up here forever."},
{"ned": " Your pardon."},
{"jaime": " I hear we might be neighbors soon. I hope it\u2019s true."},
{"ned": " Yes, the king has honored me with his offer."},
{"jaime": " I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a tournament to celebrate the new title, if you accept. It would be good to have you in the field. The competition has become a bit stale."},
{"ned": " I don\u2019t fight in tournaments."},
{"jaime": " No? Getting a little old for it?"},
{"ned": " I don\u2019t fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real, I don\u2019t want him to know what I can do."},
{"jaime": " Well said."},
{"sansa": " Arya!"},
{"robb": " Time for bed."},
{"ned": " I\u2019m a Northman. I belong here with you, not down south in that rat\u2019s nest they call a capital."},
{"catelyn": " I won\u2019t let him take you."},
{"ned": " The king takes what he wants. That\u2019s why he\u2019s king."},
{"catelyn": " I\u2019ll say, \u2018Listen, fat man, you are not taking my husband anywhere. He belongs to me now.\u2019"},
{"ned": " How did he get so fat?"},
{"catelyn": " He only stops eating when it\u2019s time for a drink."},
{"a voice": " It\u2019s Maester Luwin, my lord."},
{"ned": " Send him in."},
{"luwin": " Pardon, my lord, my lady. A rider in the night from your sister."},
{"ned": " Stay."},
{"catelyn": " This was sent from the Eyrie. What\u2019s she doing at the Eyrie? She hasn\u2019t been back there since her wedding."},
{"ned": " What news?"},
{"catelyn": " She\u2019s fled the capital. She says Jon Arryn was murdered. By the Lannisters. She says the king is in danger."},
{"ned": " She\u2019s fresh widowed, Cat. She doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying."},
{"catelyn": " Lysa\u2019s head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter. Do you think she would risk her life, her son\u2019s life, if she wasn\u2019t certain her husband was murdered?"},
{"luwin": " If this news is true, and the Lannisters conspire against the throne, who but you can protect the king?"},
{"catelyn": " They murdered the last Hand. Now you want Ned to take the job."},
{"luwin": " The king rode for a month to ask Lord Stark\u2019s help. He\u2019s the only one he trusts. You swore the king an oath, my lord."},
{"catelyn": " He spent half his life fighting Robert\u2019s wars. He owes him nothing.  Your father and brother rode south once on a king\u2019s demand."},
{"luwin": " A different time. Different king."},
{"viserys": " When do I meet with the Khal? We need to begin planning the invasion."},
{"illyrio": " If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown, you shall have it."},
{"viserys": " When?"},
{"illyrio": " When their omens favor war."},
{"viserys": " I piss on Dothraki omens. I waited 17 years to get my throne back."},
{"illyrio": " A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair."},
{"jorah": " A small gift for the new Khaleesi. Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms."},
{"daenerys": " Thank you, ser. Are you from my country?"},
{"jorah": " Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island. I served your father for many years. Gods be good, I hope to always serve the rightful king."},
{"illyrio": " Dragons\u2019 eggs, Daenerys. From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai. The ages have turned them to stone, but they will always be beautiful."},
{"daenerys": " Thank you, Magister."},
{"daenerys": " She\u2019s beautiful. \u2026 Ser Jorah, I don\u2019t know how to say \u2018thank you\u2019 in Dothraki."},

{"eddard stark": "  l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess."},
{"varys": "  When l was still a boy - before they cut my balls off with a hot knife - l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play. The same is true at court. l am the master of whisperers. My role is to be sly, obsequious and without scruples. l'm a good actor, my lord."},
{"eddard stark": "  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?"},
{"varys": "  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."},
{"eddard stark": "  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"},
{"varys": "  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom."},
{"eddard stark": "  Robb? He's just a boy."},
{"varys": "  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy."},
{"eddard stark": "  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights."},
{"varys": "  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one."},
{"eddard stark": "  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"},
{"varys": "  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."},
{"eddard stark": "  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago."},
{"varys": "  Pity. Such a pity. What of your daughter's life, my lord? ls that a precious thing to you?"},
{"robb stark": "  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda."},

{"greatjon umber": "  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look."},
{"robb stark": "  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now."},
{"theon greyjoy": "  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to."},
{"greatjon umber": "  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak."},
{"catelyn stark": "  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."},

{"catelyn stark": "  He is quite ill, my lord."},
{"walder frey": "  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."},
{"catelyn stark": "  My lord, l \u2013"},
{"walder frey": "  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine."},
{"catelyn stark": "  l'm sure there were reasons \u2013"},
{"walder frey": "  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?"},
{"catelyn stark": "  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."},
{"walder frey": "  Why should l let him?"},
{"catelyn stark": "  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."},
{"walder frey": "  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."},
{"catelyn stark": "  You swore an oath to my father."},
{"walder frey": "  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."},

{"jon snow": "  This is Valyrian steel."},
{"jeor mormont": "  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."},
{"jon snow": "  My lord, you honor me, but l can't \u2013"},
{"jeor mormont": "  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"},
{"jon snow": "  Yes, my lord."},
{"jeor mormont": "  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."},
{"jon snow": "  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight."},
{"jeor mormont": "  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist \u2013 l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."},

{"catelyn stark": "  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you."},
{"robb stark": "  What does he want in return?"},
{"catelyn stark": "  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time."},

{"jon snow": "  No."},
{"maester aemon": "  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"},
{"jon snow": "  He would do whatever was right, no matter what."},
{"maester aemon": "  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"},
{"jon snow": "  Sam told you."},
{"maester aemon": "  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."},

{"jon snow": "  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."},
{"jon snow": "  Who are you?"},

{"kevan lannister": "  They do seem rather ferocious."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."},

And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."},

{"bronn": "  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."},
{"bronn": "  For three chickens, l should hope so."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  lt didn't last long. l didn't know what the hell l was doing. But she was good to me. She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song. And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand. A few lies, a few gold coins, one drunken septon and there you have it - man and wife. For a fortnight anyway, until the septon sobered up and told my father."},
{"bronn": "  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Not quite. First, my father had Jaime tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime had arranged the whole thing - the road, the rapers, all of it. He thought it was time l had a woman. After my brother confessed, my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards. He paid her well - a silver for each man. How many whores command that kind of price? He brought me into the barracks and made me watch. By the end, she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor."},
{"bronn": "  l would have killed the man who did that to me."},
{"shae": "  You should have known she was a whore."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."},
{"shae": "  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  As l said, l was young and stupid."},
{"shae": "  You are still young and stupid."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  What is it? What do you want?"},
{"bronn": "  You're sleeping through the war."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  What?"},
{"bronn": "  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north."},

{"grand maester pycelle": " The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."},
{"eddard stark": " And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?"},
{"grand maester pycelle": " What else could it be?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Poison."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare..."},
{"eddard stark": "  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Everybody knows that."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."},
{"eddard stark": " I've taken enough of your time."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."},
{"eddard stark": "  Thank you. I'll find my own way out."},
{"arya stark": " Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours."},
{"eddard stark": "  It's a hard fall down these steps."},
{"arya stark": " Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats."},
{"eddard stark": "  Cats? Syrio says\u2026"},
{"arya stark": " He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them."},
{"eddard stark": "  He's right about that."},
{"arya stark": " Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?"},
{"eddard stark": " He needs to get his strength back first."},
{"arya stark": "He wants to be a knight of the King\u2019s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"},
{"eddard stark": " No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder."},
{"arya stark": " Can I be Lord of a holdfast?"},
{"eddard stark": " You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords."},
{"arya stark": " No. That's not me."},
{"samwell tarly": " Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."},
{"jon snow": " Come stand by the fire. It's warmer."},
{"samwell tarly": " No, that's all right. I'm fine."},
{"jon snow": " You're not. You're freezing."},
{"samwell tarly": " I don't like high places."},
{"jon snow": "  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"},
{"samwell tarly": " On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. \"You're almost a man now,\" he said, \"but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,\" he said, \"then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more.\" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"},
{"jon snow": "  Yes, he is."},
{"samwell tarly": " I'm not going to get any better, you know?"},
{"jon snow": "  Well\u2026 You can't get any worse."},
{"petyr baelish": " I hear you're reading a boring book."},
{"eddard stark": " Pycelle talks too much."},
{"petyr baelish": " He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."},
{"eddard stark": "  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?"},
{"petyr baelish": " I promised Cat that I'd help you."},
{"eddard stark": "  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him."},
{"petyr baelish": " A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?"},
{"eddard stark": " Varys or the Queen?"},
{"petyr baelish": " No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Yes."},
{"petyr baelish": " The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."},
{"eddard stark": "  Why?"},
{"petyr baelish": " I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."},
{"eddard stark": " Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."},
{"petyr baelish": " Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse."},
{"jory cassel": " Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!"},
{"hugh of the vale": " As you can see, I'm busy."},
{"jory cassel": " I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."},
{"hugh of the vale": " I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."},
{"jory cassel": " No \"ser.\" I'm not a knight."},
{"hugh of the vale": " I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."},
{"jory cassel": " He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."},
{"eddard stark": "  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way."},
{"jory cassel": " You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."},
{"eddard stark": " Let them look."},
{"tobho mott": " The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."},
{"eddard stark": "  What did Lord Arryn want?"},
{"tobho mott": " He always came to see the boy."},
{"eddard stark": "  I'd like to see him as well."},
{"tobho mott": " As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."},
{"eddard stark": " This is fine work."},
{"gendry": " It's not for sale."},
{"tobho mott": " Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."},
{"gendry": " I made it for me."},
{"tobho mott": " Forgive him, my Lord."},
{"eddard stark": " There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"},
{"gendry": " He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."},
{"eddard stark": " What kind of questions?"},
{"gendry": " About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."},
{"eddard stark": " Your mother?"},
{"gendry": " Who she was, what she looked like."},
{"eddard stark": " What did you tell him?"},
{"gendry": " She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes."},
{"eddard stark": " Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."},
{"jory cassel": " Find anything?"},
{"eddard stark": " King Robert's bastard son."},
{"jory cassel": " This is for the King from Lord Stark."},
{"jaime lannister": " Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess."},
{"jory cassel": " Three? Four?"},
{"jaime lannister": "  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister."},
{"jory cassel": " Forgive me, my Lord..."},
{"jaime lannister": " Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?"},
{"jory cassel": " We've met before, you know."},
{"jaime lannister": "  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."},
{"jory cassel": " The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon."},
{"jaime lannister": " That's where you got your scar?"},
{"jory cassel": " Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye."},
{"jaime lannister": "  Vicious sons of whores."},
{"jory cassel": " They like their bloodshed."},
{"jaime lannister": " They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?"},
{"jory cassel": " With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die."},
{"jaime lannister": "  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop."},
{"jory cassel": " Theon? He's a good lad."},
{"jaime lannister": "  I doubt it."},
{"robert baratheon": " I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here."},
{"jory cassel": " Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark."},
{"jaime lannister": " I don't serve Lord Stark."},
{"grenn": " Where have you been?"},
{"jon snow": " Watch duty. With Sam."},
{"pyp": " Prince Porkchop. Where is he?"},
{"jon snow": " He wasn't hungry."},
{"pyp": " Impossible!"},
{"jon snow": " That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."},
{"rast": " You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."},
{"jon snow": "  No one touches Sam."},
{"alliser thorne": " What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."},
{"grenn": " Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."},
{"alliser thorne": " You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"},
{"viserys targaryen": " You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!"},
{"doreah": " Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."},
{"irri": " Yes, Khaleesi."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Why did you hit her?!"},
{"viserys targaryen": " How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper."},
{"viserys targaryen": " What's this?"},
{"daenerys targaryen": " It's a gift. I had it made for you."},
{"viserys targaryen": " Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?"},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Please."},
{"viserys targaryen": " This stinks of manure. All of it."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Stop - stop it."},
{"viserys targaryen": " You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet."},
{"viserys targaryen": " You do not talk back to me!"},
{"viserys targaryen": " You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon..."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands."},
{"samwell tarly": " I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town."},
{"jon snow": " I wouldn't doubt it."},
{"samwell tarly": " Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?"},
{"jon snow": "  Sally on the side?"},
{"samwell tarly": "It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."},
{"jon snow": " I didn't think you'd be so upset about it."},
{"samwell tarly": "Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds."},
{"jon snow": "  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."},
{"samwell tarly": " I find that hard to believe."},
{"jon snow": "  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."},
{"samwell tarly": "You didn't know where to put it?"},
{"jon snow": "  I know where to put it."},
{"samwell tarly": "Was she... Old and ugly?"},
{"jon snow": "  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros."},
{"samwell tarly": " What color hair?"},
{"jon snow": " Red."},
{"samwell tarly": " I like red hair. And her... Her..."},
{"jon snow": "  You don't want to know."},
{"samwell tarly": " That good?"},
{"jon snow": " Better."},
{"samwell tarly": " Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect..."},
{"jon snow": "  What's my name?"},
{"samwell tarly": " Jon Snow?"},
{"jon snow": "  And why is my surname Snow?"},
{"samwell tarly": " Because... You're a bastard from the north."},
{"jon snow": " I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."},
{"samwell tarly": " So... You didn't know where to put it?"},
{"alliser thorne": " Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."},
{"samwell tarly": " It is a bit nippy."},
{"alliser thorne": " A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"},
{"jon snow": " I build my own fires."},
{"alliser thorne": " That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " I hit him. I hit the dragon."},
{"jorah mormont": " Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " He is still the true King."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return."},
{"jorah mormont": " The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."},
{"daenerys targaryen": "What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"},
{"jorah mormont": " Home."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home."},
{"petyr baelish": " Lover's quarrel?"},
{"sansa stark": " I'm sorry. Do I...?"},
{"septa mordane": " Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."},
{"petyr baelish": " An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time."},
{"arya stark": " Why do they call you Littlefinger?"},
{"sansa stark": " Arya!"},
{"septa mordane": " Don't be rude!"},
{"petyr baelish": " No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."},
{"robert baratheon": " I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!"},
{"sansa stark": " Gods, who is that?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother."},
{"sansa stark": " And his opponent?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come."},
{"robert baratheon": " Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"},
{"petyr baelish": " Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."},
{"sansa stark": " I won't tell anyone. I promise."},
{"petyr baelish": " No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."},
{"jory cassel": " My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."},
{"eddard stark": " Your Grace."},
{"cersei baratheon": " You're missing your tournament."},
{"eddard stark": " Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine."},
{"cersei baratheon": " I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us \u2013 the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?"},
{"eddard stark": "  She likes it here."},
{"cersei baratheon": " The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."},
{"eddard stark": " What are you doing here?"},
{"cersei baratheon": "  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?"},
{"eddard stark": "  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."},
{"cersei baratheon": " You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."},
{"eddard stark": "  If that's my job, then so be it."},
{"cersei baratheon": " You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."},
{"eddard stark": "  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."},
{"cersei baratheon": " As was I."},
{"marillion": " Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"},
{"catelyn stark": " And to you."},
{"rodrick cassel": " Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."},
{"marillion": " Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"},
{"rodrick cassel": " I'd rather throw myself down a well."},
{"marillion": " Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"},
{"masha heddle": " I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."},

{"masha heddle": " Truly, my lord, we have nothing."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?"},
{"bronn": " You can have my room."},
{"tyrion lannister": " There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."},
{"yoren": " Aye, my Lord."},
{"marillion": " My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell."},
{"masha heddle": " Lady Stark."},
{"catelyn stark": " I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"},
{"knight of house whent": " It is, my Lady."},
{"catelyn stark": " And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?"},
{"knight of house whent": " She is."},
{"catelyn stark": " The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen."},
{"knight of house bracken": " Our lord is honored by his trust."},
{"tyrion lannister": " I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."},
{"catelyn stark": " This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."},
{"eddard stark": " Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?"},
{"barristan selmy": " No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else."},
{"eddard stark": " He'd never worn this armor before."},
{"barristan selmy": " Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain."},
{"eddard stark": " Who determines the draw?"},
{"barristan selmy": " All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."},
{"eddard stark": " Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."},
{"barristan selmy": " Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident."},
{"eddard stark": " I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."},
{"barristan selmy": " You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights."},
{"eddard stark": " My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat."},
{"barristan selmy": " He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."},
{"eddard stark": " And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?"},
{"barristan selmy": " Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today."},
{"eddard stark": " Yes. That will never happen."},
{"barristan selmy": " Robert tends to do what he wants."},
{"eddard stark": " If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."},
{"lancel lannister": " It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."},
{"robert baratheon": " Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly."},
{"eddard stark": " You're too fat for your armor."},
{"robert baratheon": " Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"},
{"robert baratheon": " Oh, it\u2019s funny, is it?"},
{"lancel lannister": " No, Your Grace."},
{"robert baratheon": " No? You don't like the Hand's joke?"},
{"eddard stark": " You're torturing the poor boy."},
{"robert baratheon": " You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"},
{"eddard stark": " The breastplate stretcher?"},
{"robert baratheon": " How long before he figures it out?"},
{"eddard stark": " Maybe you should have one invented."},
{"robert baratheon": " All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."},
{"eddard stark": " You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men."},
{"robert baratheon": " Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!"},
{"eddard stark": " And who's going to hit you back?"},
{"robert baratheon": " Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!"},
{"eddard stark": "There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you."},
{"robert baratheon": " Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?"},
{"eddard stark": " Aye."},
{"robert baratheon": " \u2026 Drink."},
{"eddard stark": " I'm not thirsty."},
{"robert baratheon": " Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor."},
{"eddard stark": " Your squire... A Lannister boy?"},
{"robert baratheon": " Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. \"Cersei Lannister will make a good match\", he told me. \"You'll need her father on your side.\" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."},

{"petyr baelish": " 100 gold dragons on the Mountain."},
{"renly baratheon": " I'll take that bet."},
{"petyr baelish": " Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?"},
{"renly baratheon": " Or you could even buy a friend."},
{"sansa stark": " He's going to die."},
{"eddard stark": " Ser Loras rides well."},
{"renly baratheon": " Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."},

{"catelyn stark": " I did... often and loudly."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"},
{"catelyn stark": " And why would I do that?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first."},
{"catelyn stark": " Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"},
{"catelyn stark": " Five years ago."},
{"tyrion lannister": " She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."},
{"catelyn stark": " I am not a murderer, Lannister."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!"},
{"catelyn stark": " The dagger found"},
{"tyrion lannister": " What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?"},
{"rodrik cassel": " Should I gag him?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Why? Am I starting to make sense?"},
{"rodrik cassel": " My Lady, this way."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"},
{"catelyn stark": " Rodrik?"},
{"rodrik cassel": " I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."},
{"bronn": "  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Well, I'm willing if she is."},
{"maester luwin": " Bran..."},
{"bran stark": " The Iron Islands. Sigil - a Kraken. Words - \"We do not sow\"."},
{"maester luwin": " Lords?"},
{"bran stark": " The Greyjoys."},
{"theon greyjoy": " Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."},
{"maester luwin": " And failed rebellions."},
{"bran stark": " Sigil - a stag. - A crowned stag now that Robert's King."},
{"maester luwin": " Good."},
{"bran stark": " Words - \"Ours is the fury\". Lords - the Baratheons."},
{"bran stark": " The Westerlands - sigil - a lion."},
{"maester luwin": " Hmm..."},
{"bran stark": " Words - \"A Lannister always pays his debts.\""},
{"maester luwin": " No. A common saying, but not their official motto."},
{"bran stark": " Lords - the Lannisters."},
{"maester luwin": " We're still on their words."},
{"bran stark": " I don't know them."},
{"maester luwin": " You do know them. Think."},
{"bran stark": " \"Unbowed, unbent, unbroken\"."},
{"maester luwin": "That's House Martell."},
{"bran stark": " \"Righteous in wrath\"."},
{"maester luwin": " House Hornwood."},
{"bran stark": " \"Family, duty, honor\"."},
{"maester luwin": "Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?"},
{"bran stark": " \"Family, duty, honor\"... Is that the right order?"},
{"maester luwin": "You know it is."},
{"bran stark": " Family comes first?"},
{"maester luwin": " Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family."},
{"bran stark": " How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"},
{"maester luwin": " Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept."},
{"bran stark": " And then she left!"},
{"maester luwin": " When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."},
{"bran stark": " Why did she leave?"},
{"maester luwin": " I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."},
{"bran stark": " Do you know where she is now? Today?"},
{"maester luwin": "No, I don't."},
{"bran stark": " Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?"},
{"maester luwin": " Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good."},
{"bran stark": " I'll never shoot another arrow."},
{"maester luwin": " And where is that written?"},
{"bran stark": " You need legs to work a bow."},
{"maester luwin": " Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."},
{"bran stark": " Really?"},
{"maester luwin": " Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?"},
{"theon greyjoy": " Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls."},
{"ros": " I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here."},
{"theon greyjoy": " Important enough for the likes of you."},
{"ros": " You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."},
{"theon greyjoy": " Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman."},
{"ros": " Jealous?"},
{"theon greyjoy": " Why should I be jealous?"},
{"theon greyjoy": " Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered."},
{"ros": " Might surprise you."},
{"theon greyjoy": " Hmm?"},
{"ros": " He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue."},
{"theon greyjoy": " Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister."},
{"ros": " You are jealous."},
{"theon greyjoy": " I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."},
{"ros": " And what about the Starks?"},
{"theon greyjoy": " I\u2019ve been Lord Stark\u2019s ward since I was eight years old."},
{"ros": " A \u201cward\u201d, that\u2019s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again\u2026"},
{"theon greyjoy": " My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore."},
{"ros": " You\u2019re a very serious boy."},
{"theon greyjoy": " I\u2019m not a boy."},
{"ros": " Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."},

{"varys": " How is your son, my Lord?"},
{"eddard stark": " He'll never walk again."},
{"varys": " But his mind is sound?"},
{"eddard stark": " So they say."},
{"varys": "A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?"},
{"varys": " If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."},
{"eddard stark": " I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?"},
{"varys": " I didn't trust you."},
{"eddard stark": " So why do you trust me now?"},
{"varys": " The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."},
{"eddard stark": " What sort of doom does the King face?"},
{"varys": " The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."},
{"eddard stark": " Who gave it to him?"},
{"varys": " Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."},
{"eddard stark": " The squire, Ser Hugh?"},
{"varys": " Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."},
{"eddard stark": " If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"},
{"varys": " Someone who could afford it."},
{"eddard stark": " Jon was a man of peace. He was Hand for 17 years -- 17 good years. Why kill him?"},
{"varys": " He started asking questions."},
{"varys": " He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come."},
{"illyrio mopatis": " And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"},
{"varys": " The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."},
{"illyrio mopatis": " What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"},
{"varys": " This Hand is not the other."},
{"illyrio mopatis": " We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are."},
{"varys": " \"Delay,\" you say. \"Move fast, \" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."},
{"illyrio mopatis": " It never was."},
{"varys": " The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry."},
{"petyr baelish": " You do move quietly."},
{"varys": " We all have our qualities."},
{"petyr baelish": " You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house."},
{"varys": " I think you're mistaking business with pleasure."},
{"petyr baelish": " Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."},
{"varys": " Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."},
{"petyr baelish": " I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."},
{"varys": " Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"},
{"petyr baelish": " All desires are valid to a man with a full purse."},
{"varys": " And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot."},
{"petyr baelish": " Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."},
{"varys": " Strictly speaking."},
{"petyr baelish": " Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."},
{"varys": " Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?"},
{"varys": " Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."},
{"petyr baelish": " Saw me with your own eyes?"},
{"varys": " Eyes I own."},
{"petyr baelish": " Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark."},
{"varys": " Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen..."},
{"petyr baelish": " One shudders at the thought."},
{"varys": " Oh."},
{"petyr baelish": " But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me."},
{"varys": " Have you?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."},
{"varys": " Was that you under the bed?"},
{"petyr baelish": " And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies\u2026 To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."},
{"varys": " Oh, please."},
{"petyr baelish": " To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --"},
{"renly baratheon": " What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."},
{"petyr baelish": " To a small council meeting?"},
{"varys": " Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?"},
{"guard 1": " Off with you. No begging."},
{"arya stark": " I'm not a beggar. I live here."},
{"guard 1": " D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?"},
{"arya stark": " I want to see my father."},
{"guard 2": " I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."},
{"guard 1": " You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."},
{"arya stark": " My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"},
{"eddard stark": " You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop."},
{"arya stark": " They said they were going to kill you."},
{"eddard stark": " Who did?"},
{"arya stark": " I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."},
{"eddard stark": " Oh, Arya."},
{"arya stark": " I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage."},
{"eddard stark": " Where did you hear this?"},
{"arya stark": " In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."},
{"eddard stark": " What were you doing in the dungeons?"},
{"arya stark": " Chasing a cat."},
{"jory cassel": " Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."},
{"eddard stark": " Your name, friend?"},
{"yoren": " Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."},
{"arya stark": " I'm a girl!"},
{"eddard stark": " Did Benjen send you?"},
{"yoren": " No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."},
{"eddard stark": " Ah, we'll find recruits for you."},
{"yoren": " Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."},
{"eddard stark": " Know what?"},
{"yoren": " Best said in private, my Lord."},
{"eddard stark": " Go on. We'll talk more later."},
{"eddard stark": " Jory, take her safely to her room."},
{"jory cassel": " Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."},
{"arya stark": " How many guards does my father have?"},
{"jory cassel": " Here in King's Landing? Fifty."},
{"arya stark": " You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"},
{"jory cassel": " No fear on that count, little Lady."},
{"eddard stark": " Well?"},
{"yoren": " It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."},
{"vardis egen": " You're far from home, Lady Stark."},
{"catelyn stark": " To whom do I speak?"},
{"vardis egen": " Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"},
{"catelyn stark": " There was no time to send word."},
{"vardis egen": " May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"},
{"catelyn stark": " That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner."},
{"vardis egen": " He doesn't look like a prisoner."},
{"catelyn stark": " My sister will decide what he looks like."},
{"vardis egen": " Yes, my Lady. She will at that."},
{"tyrion lannister": " The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable."},
{"bronn": " Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch."},
{"tyrion lannister": " I like you."},
{"steward": " Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."},
{"eddard stark": " I need to see the King first -- alone."},
{"steward": " The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."},
{"eddard stark": " Is it about my wife?"},
{"steward": " No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."},
{"robert baratheon": " The whore is pregnant."},
{"eddard stark": " You're speaking of murdering a child."},
{"robert baratheon": " I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."},
{"eddard stark": " You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this."},
{"robert baratheon": " Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"},
{"eddard stark": " Then we're no better than the Mad King."},
{"robert baratheon": " Careful, Ned. Careful now."},
{"eddard stark": " You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?"},
{"varys": " No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."},
{"eddard stark": " Based on whose information?"},
{"varys": " Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens."},
{"eddard stark": " Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."},
{"eddard stark": " He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"},
{"robert baratheon": " And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army\u2026 What then?"},
{"eddard stark": " The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water."},
{"robert baratheon": " Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool."},
{"varys": " I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"},
{"renly baratheon": " We should have had them both killed years ago."},
{"petyr baelish": " When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."},
{"eddard stark": " I followed you into war -  twice, without doubts, without second thoughts. But I will not follow you now. The Robert I grew up with didn't tremble at the shadow of an unborn child."},
{"robert baratheon": " She dies."},
{"eddard stark": " I will have no part in it."},
{"robert baratheon": " You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."},
{"eddard stark": " And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man."},
{"robert baratheon": " Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"},
{"eddard stark": " I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help."},
{"jory cassel": " Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."},
{"petyr baelish": " His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word \"treason\" was mentioned."},
{"eddard stark": " What can I do for you?"},
{"petyr baelish": " When do you return to Winterfell?"},
{"eddard stark": " Why? What do you care?"},
{"petyr baelish": " If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."},
{"eddard stark": " I don't have the time."},
{"petyr baelish": " It won't take more than an hour. But as you please."},
{"eddard stark": " Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?"},
{"jory cassel": " Heward and Wyl."},
{"eddard stark": " Find them and meet me at the stables."},
{"lysa arryn": " You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, \"the seed is strong.\" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."},
{"catelyn stark": " Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"},
{"lysa arryn": " To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!"},
{"robin arryn": " Mommy? Is that the bad man?"},
{"lysa arryn": " It is."},
{"robin arryn": " He's little."},
{"lysa arryn": " He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man."},
{"lysa arryn": " You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me."},
{"tyrion lannister": " If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."},
{"robin arryn": " You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"},
{"lysa arryn": " Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."},
{"robin arryn": " Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly."},
{"lysa arryn": " Perhaps you will, my little love."},
{"catelyn stark": " This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed."},
{"lysa arryn": " Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."},
{"mord": " You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"},
{"loras tyrell": " Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head."},
{"renly baratheon": " Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."},
{"loras tyrell": " You're jealous."},
{"renly baratheon": " Are you sure this won't hurt?"},
{"loras tyrell": " Only if I slip."},
{"renly baratheon": " And you prefer me like this?"},
{"loras tyrell": " Mhmm."},
{"renly baratheon": " If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."},
{"loras tyrell": " I want you."},
{"renly baratheon": " My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"},
{"loras tyrell": " Hold still."},
{"renly baratheon": " All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."},
{"loras tyrell": " You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the m\u00eal\u00e9e."},
{"renly baratheon": "His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!"},
{"loras tyrell": " He shouldn't have entered the m\u00eal\u00e9e if he didn't know how to fight."},
{"renly baratheon": " Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman."},
{"loras tyrell": " It's not a gift. No one gave it to me. I'm good because I work at it -- every day of my life since I could hold a stick."},
{"renly baratheon": " I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."},
{"loras tyrell": " Yes well, I guess we'll never know."},
{"renly baratheon": " Everywhere?"},
{"loras tyrell": " Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?"},
{"renly baratheon": " It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."},
{"loras tyrell": " It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife."},
{"renly baratheon": " He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."},
{"loras tyrell": " I have an outrageous amount of money."},
{"renly baratheon": " Not as much as the Lannisters."},
{"loras tyrell": " But a lot more than you."},
{"renly baratheon": " Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."},
{"loras tyrell": " Hmm... How did that ever happen?"},
{"renly baratheon": " Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it."},
{"loras tyrell": " Do you know who should be King?"},
{"renly baratheon": " Be serious."},
{"loras tyrell": " I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."},
{"renly baratheon": " I'm fourth in line."},
{"loras tyrell": " And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight."},
{"renly baratheon": " Stannis?"},
{"loras tyrell": " Stannis has the personality of a lobster."},
{"renly baratheon": " He's still my older brother."},
{"renly baratheon": " What are you doing?!"},
{"loras tyrell": " Look at it."},
{"renly baratheon": " You cut me!"},
{"loras tyrell": " It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."},
{"loras tyrell": " You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."},
{"cersei baratheon": " I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together."},
{"robert baratheon": " I'm glad I could do something to make you happy."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."},
{"robert baratheon": " I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime."},
{"cersei baratheon": " No. He's not serious enough. I'll say this for Ned Stark - he's serious enough. Was it really worth it? Losing him this way?"},
{"robert baratheon": " I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."},
{"cersei baratheon": " The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons."},
{"robert baratheon": " It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Is my father wrong?"},
{"robert baratheon": " Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."},
{"cersei baratheon": " We still outnumber them."},
{"robert baratheon": " Which is the bigger number -- five or one?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " Five."},
{"robert baratheon": " Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."},
{"cersei baratheon": " What do you want?"},
{"robert baratheon": " We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Our marriage."},
{"robert baratheon": " Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " Every day."},
{"robert baratheon": " How long can hate hold a thing together?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."},
{"robert baratheon": " Yes, it is."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Yes, it tis. What was she like?"},
{"robert baratheon": " You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."},
{"robert baratheon": " So why now?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?"},
{"robert baratheon": " You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."},
{"cersei baratheon": " I felt something for you once, you know?"},
{"robert baratheon": " I know."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Even after we lost our first boy -- for quite a while, actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a... moment?"},
{"robert baratheon": " No. Does that make you feel better or worse?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " It doesn't make me feel anything."},
{"mhaegen": " She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."},
{"eddard stark": " Aye."},
{"mhaegen": " Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."},
{"eddard stark": " I will."},
{"mhaegen": " And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."},
{"eddard stark": " When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"},
{"mhaegen": " He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."},
{"eddard stark": " She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing."},
{"petyr baelish": " Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."},
{"eddard stark": " What do you know of King Robert's bastards?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Well, he has more than you, for a start."},
{"eddard stark": " How many?"},
{"petyr baelish": " Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."},
{"eddard stark": " And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?"},
{"petyr baelish": " He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love."},
{"eddard stark": " Come."},
{"eddard stark": " Jory!"},
{"jory cassel": " My Lord."},
{"jaime lannister": " Such a small pack of wolves."},
{"jory cassel": " Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"},
{"jaime lannister": " Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away."},
{"petyr baelish": " What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"},
{"jaime lannister": " Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."},
{"eddard stark": " I remember him well."},
{"jaime lannister": " It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"},
{"eddard stark": "He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes."},
{"petyr baelish": " My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!"},
{"jaime lannister": " Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."},
{"jory cassel": " If you threaten my Lord again..."},
{"jaime lannister": " Threaten? As in, \"I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of\u201d?"},
{"eddard stark": " You kill me, your brother's a dead man."},
{"jaime lannister": " You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!"},
{"jaime lannister": " My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."},
{"king\u2019s landing guard": " Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."},
{"eddard stark": " Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."},
{"jory cassel": " Yes, my Lord."},
{"king\u2019s landing guard": " If you'd like to change into something more appropriate\u2026"},
{"jaime lannister": " Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."},
{"eddard stark": " Glad to see you're protecting the throne."},
{"jaime lannister": " Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."},
{"eddard stark": "  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it."},
{"jaime lannister": " I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."},
{"eddard stark": " You've chosen your opponents wisely then."},
{"jaime lannister": " I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."},
{"eddard stark": "  But you just stood there and watched."},
{"jaime lannister": " 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."},
{"eddard stark": " Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?"},
{"jaime lannister": " Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"},
{"eddard stark": "  You served him well, when serving was safe."},
{"varys": " Lord Stark."},
{"eddard stark": " Lord Varys."},
{"varys": " I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery."},
{"eddard stark": "  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well."},
{"renly baratheon": " And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."},
{"petyr baelish": " But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."},
{"eddard stark": "  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."},
{"petyr baelish": " All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone."},
{"eddard stark": " Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with."},
{"petyr baelish": " It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."},
{"eddard stark": "  Grand Maester."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " How many years has it been? You were a young man."},
{"eddard stark": " And you served another King."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Without the King?"},
{"renly baratheon": " Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."},
{"varys": " His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load."},
{"petyr baelish": "  We are the lords of small matters here."},
{"renly baratheon": " My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Mmm, how much?"},
{"eddard stark": " 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " Can the treasury bear such expense?"},
{"petyr baelish": "  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?"},
{"petyr baelish": " I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt."},
{"eddard stark": "  How could you let this happen?"},
{"petyr baelish": "  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it."},
{"eddard stark": "  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."},
{"renly baratheon": " \"Counting coppers,\" he calls it."},
{"eddard stark": "  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford."},
{"petyr baelish": "  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."},
{"eddard stark": "  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."},
{"varys": " You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Please, it's nearly healed."},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  It's ugly."},
{"cersei baratheon": " A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."},
{"cersei baratheon": " That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."},
{"joffrey baratheon": " Do I have to marry her?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  I don't want to."},
{"cersei baratheon": " No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."},
{"joffrey baratheon": " We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals."},
{"cersei baratheon": " How would you handle them?"},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."},
{"cersei baratheon": "  A royal army?"},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."},
{"cersei baratheon": " And if the northerners rebel?"},
{"joffrey baratheon": " I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."},
{"cersei baratheon": " And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  For me. I'm their King."},
{"cersei baratheon": "  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  I'm not asking."},
{"cersei baratheon": " The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."},
{"joffrey baratheon": "  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?"},
{"cersei baratheon": "  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy."},
{"septa mordane": " Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."},
{"arya stark": "  I'm practicing."},
{"sansa stark": "  Practicing for what?"},
{"arya stark": " The Prince."},
{"septa mordane": " Arya, stop!"},
{"arya stark": " He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend."},
{"sansa stark": " The Hound killed your friend."},
{"arya stark": " The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do."},
{"sansa stark": " You're an idiot."},
{"arya stark": " You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."},
{"septa mordane": " Enough!"},
{"eddard stark": "  What's happening here?"},
{"septa mordane": " Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady."},
{"eddard stark": "  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love\u2026"},
{"eddard stark": "  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?"},
{"sansa stark": " I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?"},
{"septa mordane": " You've barely eaten a thing."},
{"eddard stark": "  It's all right. Go on."},
{"eddard stark": " War was easier than daughters."},
{"arya stark": " Go away!"},
{"eddard stark": " Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"},
{"arya stark": "  Mine."},
{"eddard stark": "  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords."},
{"arya stark": " I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady."},
{"eddard stark": "  Come here. Now what do you want with this?"},
{"arya stark": "  It's called Needle."},
{"eddard stark": "  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?"},
{"arya stark": " Stick 'em with the pointy end."},
{"eddard stark": "  That's the essence of it."},
{"arya stark": " I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault."},
{"eddard stark": "  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."},
{"arya stark": " I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."},
{"eddard stark": "  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar."},
{"arya stark": " So was I! He is a liar."},
{"eddard stark": " Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."},
{"arya stark": " But how you can let her marry someone like that?"},
{"eddard stark": " Well\u2026 Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words."},
{"arya stark": " Winter is coming."},
{"eddard stark": " You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."},
{"arya stark": " I don't hate her. Not really."},
{"eddard stark": " I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."},
{"arya stark": " I can keep it?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."},
{"old nan": "  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow."},
{"bran stark": "  I hate your stories."},
{"old nan": "  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites."},
{"bran stark": " Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones."},
{"old nan": " Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds\u2026"},
{"robb stark": "  What are you telling him now?"},
{"old nan": " Only what the little Lord wants to hear."},
{"robb stark": "  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber."},
{"bran stark": "  Maybe we do."},
{"robb stark": "  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."},
{"bran stark": "  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."},
{"robb stark": " Don't ever say that."},
{"bran stark": " I'd rather be dead."},
{"rodrick cassel": " Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."},
{"catelyn stark": "  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either."},
{"rodrick cassel": " My Lady."},
{"guard": " Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"},
{"catelyn stark": "  I would. We've done nothing wrong."},
{"guard": " We've been instructed to escort you into the city."},
{"catelyn stark": " Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."},
{"guard": " Follow me, Lady Stark."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. "},
{"catelyn stark": "  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a\u2026"},
{"petyr baelish": " I meant no disrespect to you of all people."},
{"catelyn stark": "  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?"},
{"petyr baelish": "  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale."},
{"catelyn stark": "  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?"},
{"petyr baelish": " A dear friend told me."},
{"varys": "  Lady Stark."},
{"catelyn stark": "  Lord Varys."},
{"varys": "  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands."},
{"catelyn stark": " How did you know I was coming?"},
{"varys": "  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."},
{"catelyn stark": "  Do you know whose dagger this is?"},
{"varys": "  I must admit I do not."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."},
{"catelyn stark": "  Yours?"},
{"petyr baelish": " At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."},
{"catelyn stark": " To whom?"},
{"petyr baelish": "  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp."},
{"alliser thorne": " If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"},
{"alliser thorne": " Next!"},
{"alliser thorne": " Next!"},
{"alliser thorne": " Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."},
{"tyrion lannister": " A charming man."},
{"jeor mormont": " I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch."},
{"tyrion lannister": " And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"},
{"jeor mormont": " Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Good news or bad?"},
{"jeor mormont": " Both."},
{"grand maester pycelle": " Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?"},
{"eddard stark": "  My wife is in Winterfell."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Is she?"},
{"petyr baelish": "  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own."},
{"eddard stark": " You're a funny man. A very funny man."},
{"catelyn stark": "  Ned! "},
{"petyr baelish": " The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."},
{"grenn": " You broke my nose, bastard!"},
{"jon snow": "  It's an improvement."},
{"grenn": " If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."},
{"pyp": " I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did."},
{"grenn": " What're you looking at, halfman?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you."},
{"rast": " What do you care about our faces?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."},
{"grenn": " We'll talk later, Lord Snow."},
{"jon snow": " Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same."},
{"jon snow": " They hate me because I'm better than they are."},
{"tyrion lannister": " It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up."},
{"petyr baelish": " The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason."},
{"catelyn stark": " We have proof. We have the blade."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."},
{"catelyn stark": "  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust."},
{"petyr baelish": "  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."},
{"catelyn stark": " I won't forget this. You're a true friend."},
{"petyr baelish": "  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain."},
{"cersei baratheon": " How could you be so stupid?"},
{"jaime lannister": " Calm down."},
{"cersei baratheon": " He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?"},
{"jaime lannister": " I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing."},
{"jaime lannister": " Then what are you raving about?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw..."},
{"jaime lannister": " We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old."},
{"cersei baratheon": " And my husband?"},
{"cersei baratheon": " Let me go."},
{"jaime lannister": " Never."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Let me go."},
{"jaime lannister": " The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."},
{"catelyn stark": "  I wish I could see the girls."},
{"eddard stark": "  It's too dangerous."},
{"catelyn stark": " Just for a moment."},
{"eddard stark": "  Until we know who our enemies are..."},
{"catelyn stark": " I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."},
{"eddard stark": "  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof."},
{"cersei baratheon": " And if you find the proof?"},
{"eddard stark": " Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."},
{"catelyn stark": " My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."},
{"eddard stark": " He still loves you."},
{"catelyn stark": " Does he?"},
{"eddard stark": " Off with you."},
{"robert baratheon": "  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?"},
{"barristan selmy": " Of course, your Grace."},
{"robert baratheon": "  Who was it?"},
{"barristan selmy": " A Tyroshi. Never learned the name."},
{"robert baratheon": " How'd you do it?"},
{"barristan selmy": " Lance through the heart."},
{"robert baratheon": " Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, \"Wait! Wait!\"... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"},
{"lancel lannister": " It's empty, your Grace."},
{"robert baratheon": " What do you mean it's empty?"},
{"lancel lannister": " There's no more wine."},
{"robert baratheon": "  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"},
{"jaime lannister": " One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood."},
{"barristan selmy": " I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."},
{"jaime lannister": " You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw."},
{"barristan selmy": " A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."},
{"robert baratheon": " Your outlaw... Any last words?"},
{"jaime lannister": " I cut his head off, so no."},
{"robert baratheon": " What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?"},
{"jaime lannister": " He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... \"Burn them all.\" If that's all, your Grace..."},
{"jorah mormont": "  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " From whom?"},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Tell them all to stop."},
{"jorah mormont": " You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?"},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  Until I command them otherwise."},
{"jorah mormont": "  You're learning to talk like a Queen."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Not a Queen. A Khaleesi."},
{"viserys targaryen": " You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?"},
{"irri": " Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  No!"},
{"irri": " Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."},
{"viserys targaryen": " Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!"},
{"jorah mormont": "  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"},
{"rakharo": " You walk. "},
{"benjen stark": "  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning."},
{"jon snow": " You're leaving?"},
{"benjen stark": " I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports."},
{"jon snow": "  What kind of reports?"},
{"benjen stark": "  The kind I don't want to believe."},
{"jon snow": " 'm ready. I won't let you down."},
{"benjen stark": " You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."},
{"jon snow": " But I'm better than every..."},
{"benjen stark": " Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."},
{"yoren": " A bear's balls."},
{"tyrion lannister": " You're joking?"},
{"yoren": " And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."},
{"tyrion lannister": " And how do a bear's balls taste?"},
{"yoren": " A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"},
{"yoren": " But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory."},
{"tyrion lannister": " They have a better chance finding feed than glory."},
{"benjen stark": " The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."},
{"benjen stark": "  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"},
{"benjen stark": " Call me what you like."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger."},
{"benjen stark": " You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word \"but\" really counts."},
{"tyrion lannister": " But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."},
{"benjen stark": "  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."},
{"yoren": " Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."},
{"benjen stark": "  Enjoy the capital, brother."},
{"yoren": " I always do."},
{"tyrion lannister": " I think he's starting to like me. \"Going below\"?"},
{"yoren": " Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two."},
{"tyrion lannister": " So you're heading down to King's Landing too."},
{"yoren": " Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Let's share the road. I could use some decent company."},
{"yoren": " I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister."},
{"irri": " Yes, Khaleesi."},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  What are you doing?"},
{"irri": " When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It\u2019s a blessing from the Great Stallion."},
{"jorah mormont": "  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."},
{"rakharo": " Dothraki don\u2019t wear steel dresses."},
{"jorah mormont": " Armor."},
{"rakharo": " Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?"},
{"jorah mormont": "  Slow."},
{"rakharo": " Slow."},
{"jorah mormont": " It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."},
{"rakharo": " My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size."},
{"jorah mormont": "  I\u2019ve heard that your father was a famous warrior."},
{"rakharo": " He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"},
{"jorah mormont": " He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him."},
{"irri": " The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits."},
{"rakharo": " There are no rabbits."},
{"irri": " Find some ducks, she likes ducks."},
{"rakharo": " Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"},
{"irri": " Dog then. I have seen many dogs."},
{"jorah mormont": " I don't think she wants to eat dog."},
{"irri": " The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell."},
{"rakharo": " A blessing from the Great Stallion."},
{"irri": " She does not want to eat horse."},
{"jorah mormont": " I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor."},
{"rhakaro": " We ride for Vaes Dothrak."},
{"jorah mormont": " Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find."},
{"jon snow": " Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me."},
{"maester aemon": " How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Eight... no, nine."},
{"maester aemon": " All of them brief?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."},
{"jeor mormont": " We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."},
{"jeor mormont": " One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off."},
{"maester aemon": " The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed."},
{"jeor mormont": " Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help."},
{"maester aemon": " When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  It\u2019s a boy."},
{"khal drogo": " How do you know?"},
{"daenerys targaryen": " I know."},
{"jon snow": "  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."},
{"tyrion lannister": " It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere."},
{"jon snow": "  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing."},
{"jon snow": "  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Of course."},
{"jon snow": " He'll never walk again."},
{"tyrion lannister": " If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."},
{"jon snow": " Farewell, My Lord."},
{"syrio forel": "  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."},
{"arya stark": "  Who are you?"},
{"syrio forel": " Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."},
{"syrio forel": " Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."},
{"arya stark": "  It's too heavy."},
{"syrio forel": "  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate."},
{"arya stark": " What if I drop it?"},
{"syrio forel": " The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."},
{"arya stark": " I'm a girl."},
{"syrio forel": "  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."},
{"arya stark": "  A needle."},
{"syrio forel": " Ahhh\u2026 Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."},
{"syrio forel": " Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."},
{"jorah mormont": " You need to drink, child... And eat."},
{"daenerys targaryen": " Isn't there anything else?"},
{"doreah": " Khaleesi!"},
{"irri": " Your hands."},
{"jorah mormont": " We're still not far from Pentos, your Grace. Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality. You'd be more comfortable there."},
{"viserys targaryen": " I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown."},
{"jorah mormont": " As you wish, your Grace."},
{"viserys targaryen": " Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"},
{"jorah mormont": " Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land."},
{"viserys targaryen": " Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."},
{"joffrey baratheon": " Better-looking bitches than you're used to, Uncle. My mother's been looking for you. We ride for King's Landing today."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Before you go, you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies."},
{"joffrey baratheon": " What good will my sympathies do them?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted."},
{"joffrey baratheon": " The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women."},
{"tyrion lannister": " One word and I'll hit you again."},
{"joffrey baratheon": " I'm telling mother!"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"},
{"joffrey baratheon": " You can't..."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Do you understand?"},
{"sandor clegane": " The Prince will remember that, little lord."},
{"tyrion lannister": " I hope so. If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him. Time for breakfast..."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Bread. And two of those little fish. And a mug of dark beer to wash it down. And bacon, burnt black."},
{"jaime lannister": " Little brother."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Beloved siblings."},
{"myrcella baratheon": " Is Bran going to die?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Apparently not."},
{"cersei baratheon": " What do you mean?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " The Maester says the boy may live."},
{"cersei baratheon": " It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you."},
{"cersei baratheon": " I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."},
{"jaime lannister": " Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black."},
{"tyrion lannister": " And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world."},
{"cersei baratheon": " The children don't need to hear your filth. Come."},
{"jaime lannister": " Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."},
{"jaime lannister": " My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."},
{"tyrion lannister": " My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Please."},
{"catelyn stark": "  I would have dressed, your Grace."},
{"cersei baratheon": " This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."},
{"catelyn stark": " I never knew."},
{"cersei baratheon": "  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."},
{"catelyn stark": "  I am grateful.."},
{"cersei baratheon": " Perhaps this time she'll listen."},
{"jaime lannister": " A sword for the wall?"},
{"jon snow": " I already have one."},
{"jaime lannister": " Good man. Have you swung it yet?"},
{"jon snow": " Of course I have."},
{"jaime lannister": "  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."},
{"jon snow": " We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years."},
{"jaime lannister": " Is it \"we\" already? Have you taken your vows then?"},
{"jon snow": " Soon enough."},
{"jaime lannister": " Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."},
{"arya stark": " Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. \"My things weren't properly folded\", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."},
{"jon snow": " It's good you've got help."},
{"arya stark": " Watch. Nymeria, gloves."},
{"jon snow": "  Impressive."},
{"arya stark": "  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"},
{"jon snow": "  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully."},
{"arya stark": "  A present?"},
{"jon snow": "  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself."},
{"arya stark": "  It's so skinny."},
{"jon snow": " So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."},
{"arya stark": " I can be quick."},
{"jon snow": "  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?"},
{"arya stark": " I think so."},
{"arya stark": "  I know which end to use."},
{"jon snow": "  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."},
{"arya stark": "  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own."},
{"jon snow": "  I came to say goodbye to Bran."},
{"catelyn stark": "  You've said it."},
{"jon snow": "  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."},
{"catelyn stark": " I want you to leave."},
{"catelyn stark": " 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again."},
{"eddard stark": "  I have no choice."},
{"catelyn stark": " That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."},
{"eddard stark": "  You can. You must."},
{"robb stark": " You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it."},
{"jon snow": "  You Starks are hard to kill."},
{"robb stark": " My mother?"},
{"jon snow": "  She was very kind."},
{"robb stark": " Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."},
{"jon snow": "  It was always my color."},
{"robb stark": " Farewell, Snow."},
{"jon snow": "  And you, Stark."},
{"eddard stark": " There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."},
{"jon snow": " Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"},
{"eddard stark": " The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."},
{"robert baratheon": " Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."},
{"eddard stark": "  I've half a mind to go with you."},
{"robert baratheon": " What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."},
{"eddard stark": " You should have asked me 20 years ago."},
{"robert baratheon": " There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."},
{"eddard stark": "  I recall a few chances."},
{"robert baratheon": " There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."},
{"eddard stark": "  Bessie. She was one of yours."},
{"robert baratheon": " Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?"},
{"eddard stark": "  Wylla."},
{"robert baratheon": " That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like."},
{"eddard stark": "  Nor will I."},
{"robert baratheon": " We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."},
{"eddard stark": " The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again."},
{"robert baratheon": " Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."},
{"eddard stark": "  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?"},
{"robert baratheon": " A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."},
{"eddard stark": " She's little more than a child."},
{"robert baratheon": " Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding."},
{"eddard stark": "  Tell me we're not speaking of this."},
{"robert baratheon": " Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."},
{"eddard stark": "  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"},
{"robert baratheon": "  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."},
{"eddard stark": " Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."},
{"robert baratheon": "  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."},
{"eddard stark": " He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."},
{"robert baratheon": " There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."},
{"benjen stark": " Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one."},
{"jon snow": " Why do you read so much?"},
{"tyrion lannister": " Look at me and tell me what you see."},
{"jon snow": "  Is this a trick?"},
{"tyrion lannister": "  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."},
{"jon snow": " Until your brother killed that King."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"},
{"jon snow": " Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."},
{"tyrion lannister": "  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."},
{"jon snow": " The Night's Watch protects the realm from..."},
{"tyrion lannister": " Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."},
{"maester luwin": " It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."},
{"catelyn stark": "  Talk to Poole about it."},
{"maester luwin": " Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."},
{"catelyn stark": " I don't care about appointments!"},
{"robb stark": "  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning."},
{"maester luwin": " Very good, my Lord. My Lady."},
{"robb stark": "  When was the last time you left this room?"},
{"catelyn stark": "  I have to take care of him."},
{"robb stark": " He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."},
{"catelyn stark": " What if he's wrong? Bran needs me."},
{"robb stark": " Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."},
{"catelyn stark": " Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! "},
{"robb stark": "  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back."},
{"assassin": " You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already."},
{"catelyn stark": "  No!"},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  Have you ever seen a dragon?"},
{"irri": " Dragon gone, Khaleesi."},
{"daenerys targaryen": "  Everywhere? Even in the east?"},
{"irri": " No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known."},
{"jhiqui": " It is known."},

Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."},

{"euron": " We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."},
{"jaime": " Perhaps you ought to sit down."},
{"euron": " Why?"},
{"cersei": " Sit down or leave."},
{"tyrion": " We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."},
{"cersei": " So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"},
{"tyrion": " We all know that will never happen."},
{"cersei": " Then why are we here?"},
{"jon": " This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead."},
{"cersei": " I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement."},
{"jon": " This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't."},
{"cersei": " I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."},
{"daenerys": " Yes. That's all."},
{"cersei": " That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men."},
{"daenerys": " Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word."},

{"tyrion": " There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you."},
{"jon": "  We can destroy them by burning them."},

{"euron": " Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands."},

{"euron": " I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."},
{"euron": " I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."},
{"cersei": " He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."},
{"jon": " "},
{"cersei": " In return, the King"},

{"cersei": "  I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."},
{"jon": " I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen."},

{"brienne": " Oh, fuck loyalty!"},

{"brienne": " This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen."},
{"jaime": " And tell her what?"},
{"davos": " I wish you hadn't done that."},

{"tyrion": " I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have."},
{"cersei": " You killed our father"},

As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."},

Now that you\u2019ve seen more of the world, you\u2019ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you\u2019ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry?  My point is\u2026 we don\u2019t choose whom we love. We just\u2026 It\u2019s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."},

{"grey worm": " I am."},

{"daario": " And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen\u2019s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious.  Try not to ruin her.  Looks like it\u2019s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let\u2019s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."},

I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up.  I\u2019ll be gone for a few days, Princess.

{"ellaria": " No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."},

{"doran": " Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King\u2019s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"},
{"jaime": " He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it\u2019s me."},

{"ellaria": " I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that."},
{"shireen": " Father. Aren\u2019t you cold?"},
{"stannis": " No. What are you reading?"},
{"shireen": " The Dance of Dragons."},
{"stannis": " What\u2019s it about?"},
{"shireen": " It\u2019s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."},
{"stannis": " \u201cThe dance of dragons\u201d? Why is that a dance?"},
{"shireen": " That\u2019s just what they call it."},
{"stannis": " Doesn\u2019t make much sense."},
{"shireen": " I think it\u2019s poetic."},
{"stannis": " If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"},
{"shireen": " I wouldn\u2019t have chosen either. It\u2019s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible."},
{"stannis": " Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."},
{"shireen": " It\u2019s alright, father."},
{"stannis": " You don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about."},
{"shireen": " It doesn\u2019t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?"},
{"stannis": " Yes there is."},
{"shireen": " Good, I want to. I\u2019m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I\u2019m your daughter."},
{"stannis": " Forgive me."},
{"shireen": " Where\u2019s my father? I want to see my father."},
{"melisandre": " It will all be over soon, Princess."},
{"shireen": " Where\u2019s my father? No you can\u2019t do this, father where are you?!"},
{"shireen": " Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"},
{"selyse": " It\u2019s what the Lord wants. It\u2019s a good thing. A great thing."},
{"melisandre": " The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."},
{"selyse": " If we don\u2019t act then we\u2019ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice\u2026"},
{"melisandre": " Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"},
{"shireen": " Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"},
{"selyse": " I can\u2019t."},
{"stannis": " There\u2019s no other way. She has King\u2019s blood."},
{"melisandre": " Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"},
{"shireen": " Mother, don\u2019t do this please! Please help! Don\u2019t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"},
{"selyse": " No..."},
{"daenerys": " Where have you been?"},
{"hizdahr": " Just making sure everything\u2019s in order."},
{"announcer": " Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"},
{"quick": " I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."},
{"strong": " I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."},
{"hizdahr": " They\u2019re waiting for you. Clap your hands."},
{"daario": " That one, the smaller man, no question, that\u2019s where you should put your money."},
{"tyrion": " The smaller man it is."},
{"daenerys": " I\u2019m not putting my money anywhere."},
{"hizdahr": " Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does."},
{"daario": " People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits.  He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake."},
{"hizdahr": " I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."},
{"daenerys": " Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"},
{"daario": " Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn\u2019t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here  or here . And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren\u2019t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."},
{"hizdahr": " You don\u2019t approve?"},
{"tyrion": " There\u2019s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time."},
{"hizdahr": " Fair enough, yet -- it\u2019s an unpleasant question -- but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty?"},
{"tyrion": " It\u2019s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor."},
{"hizdahr": " I\u2019m not talking about myself. I\u2019m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness."},
{"daenerys": " That is greatness?"},
{"hizdahr": " That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt."},
{"tyrion": " My father would have liked you."},
{"daenerys": " One day your great city will return to the dirt as well."},
{"hizdahr": " At your command?"},
{"daenerys": " If need be."},
{"announcer": " A Meereenese champion?"},
{"hizdahr": " How many people will die to make this happen?"},
{"daenerys": " If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason."},
{"hizdahr": " Those men think they\u2019re dying for a good reason."},
{"daenerys": " Someone else\u2019s reason."},
{"hizdahr": " So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don\u2019t know their own minds, but you do."},
{"tyrion": " Well said, you\u2019re an eloquent man. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."},
{"announcer": " ...or a Westerosi Knight?!"},
{"jorah": " I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."},
{"hizdahr": " Your Grace--"},
{"daario": " Shut your mouth."},
{"tyrion": " You can end this."},
{"hizdahr": " She cannot."},
{"tyrion": " You can!"},
{"daario": " Protect your queen!"},
{"hizdahr": " Your Grace, Your Grace, come with me! I know a way out! I know a way--"},
{"tyrion": " Stay close!"},
{"jorah": " This way!"},
{"daario": " The other side, follow me!"},
{"daario": " Protect your queen!"},
{"daenerys": " Drogon!"},
{"daenerys": " Valahd.."},
{"jorah": " Your Grace, I want to say--"},
{"daenerys": " You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?"},
{"tyrion": " If only I were otherwise."},
{"daenerys": " If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn\u2019t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine"},
{"tyrion": " You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time."},
{"daenerys": " So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?"},
{"tyrion": " Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It\u2019s too soon to know if you deserve my service."},
{"daenerys": " If you\u2019d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word."},
{"tyrion": " When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."},
{"daenerys": " And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?"},
{"tyrion": " Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you."},
{"daenerys": " I have a very large army and very large dragons."},
{"tyrion": " Killing and politics aren\u2019t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name."},
{"daenerys": " So you want to advise me. Very well.  What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned."},
{"tyrion": " I know."},
{"daenerys": " Why should the people trust a queen who can\u2019t keep her promises?"},
{"tyrion": " Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can\u2019t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."},
{"tyrion": " Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?"},
{"daenerys": " Yes, many opportunities."},
{"tyrion": " And did he?"},
{"daenerys": " No. Not until forced to do so."},
{"tyrion": " He worships you. He is in love with you, I think. But he did not trust you with the truth - an unpleasant truth, to be sure - but one of great significance to you. He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him."},
{"daenerys": " So I should kill him?"},
{"tyrion": " A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you\u2019re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you\u2019re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."},
{"daenerys": " Remove Ser Jorah from the city."},
{"septa": " Confess."},
{"cersei": " My son. Let me speak to--"},
{"septa": " Confess. I meant it."},

{"arya": " Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"},

{"arya": " What will she do there?"},
{"jaqen": " She will see."},
{"arya": " See what?"},
{"jaqen": " How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."},

{"jaqen": " The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life."},

{"jaqen": " A girl tells a man that she has seen."},
{"arya": " If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."},
{"jaqen": " But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn\u2019t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"},
{"arya": " The Many Faced God. You said you didn\u2019t know what I would see at the docks."},
{"jaqen": " A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself."},

{"jaqen": " A gift for the Thin Man."},

{"qyburn": " Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you\u2019ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."},
{"cersei": " I wish you\u2019d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?"},
{"qyburn": " I\u2019m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."},

{"theon": " They weren\u2019t \u201cthose boys\u201d, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you\u2019d know them since they were born."},

{"roose": " You disagree?"},
{"ramsay": " Stannis isn\u2019t from the North. You are, father. I think you\u2019re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."},
{"roose": " And what do you recommend?"},
{"ramsay": " That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."},
{"roose": " A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can\u2019t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn\u2019t get an army through if we wanted to."},
{"ramsay": " I don\u2019t need an army. I need 20 good men."},

{"tyrion": " Have you decided yet whether you\u2019re going to have me killed?"},
{"daenerys": " It\u2019s probably my safest option."},
{"tyrion": " I can see why you would think so. It\u2019s what your father would have done."},
{"daenerys": " And what would your father do?"},
{"tyrion": " My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I\u2019d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear."},
{"daenerys": " Is that why you killed him?"},
{"tyrion": " Some day if you decide not to execute me, I\u2019ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we\u2019ll need more wine than this."},
{"daenerys": " I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name."},
{"tyrion": " So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."},
{"daenerys": " I\u2019m terrible?"},
{"tyrion": " I\u2019ve heard stories."},
{"danerys": " Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?"},
{"tyrion": " To see if you were the right kind of terrible."},
{"daenerys": " Which kind is that?"},
{"tyrion": " The kind that prevents your people from being even more so."},
{"daenerys": " I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment."},
{"tyrion": "  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."},
{"daenerys": " Perhaps it won\u2019t come to that."},
{"tyrion": " It\u2019s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all."},
{"daenerys": " Varys? King Robert\u2019s spy master?"},
{"tyrion": " Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself."},
{"daenerys": " Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me."},
{"tyrion": " He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn\u2019t have to do. I suspect he\u2019s the main reason you weren\u2019t slaughtered in your crib."},
{"daenerys": " But you trust him?"},
{"tyrion": " Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."},
{"daenerys": " The brother who killed my father."},
{"tyrion": " That\u2019s the one."},
{"daenerys": " Perhaps I will have you killed after all."},
{"tyrion": " Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."},
{"daenerys": " I\u2019m not going to kill you."},
{"tyrion": " No? Banish me?"},
{"daenerys": " No."},
{"tyrion": " So if I\u2019m not going to be murdered, and I\u2019m not going to be banished..."},
{"daenerys": " You\u2019re going to advise me.  While you can still speak in complete sentences."},
{"tyrion": " Advise you on what?"},
{"daenerys": " How to get what I want."},
{"tyrion": " The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else."},
{"daenerys": " If I want jokes I\u2019ll get myself a proper fool."},
{"tyrion": " I\u2019m not entirely joking. There\u2019s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good."},
{"daenerys": " I fought so that no child born into Slaver\u2019s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home."},
{"tyrion": " And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"},
{"daenerys": " The common people."},
{"tyrion": " Let\u2019s be generous and assume that\u2019s going to happen. Here in Slaver\u2019s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won\u2019t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won\u2019t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."},
{"daenerys": " Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They\u2019re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."},

{"tormund": " War."},

{"lord of bones": " Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you\u2019re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"},
{"tormund": " Gather the elders and let\u2019s talk."},
{"jon": " My name\u2019s Jon Snow. I\u2019m Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch. We\u2019re not friends. We\u2019ve never been friends. We won\u2019t become friends today. This isn\u2019t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what\u2019s out there."},
{"karsi": " You built that wall to keep us out."},
{"loboda": " Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?"},
{"jon": " In normal times we wouldn\u2019t. But these aren\u2019t normal times. The white walkers don\u2019t care if a man\u2019s Free Folk or Crow. We\u2019re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them."},
{"karsi": " Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."},
{"jon": " It\u2019s not a trick. It\u2019s a gift for those who join us."},
{"jon": " Dragonglass. A man of the Night\u2019s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker."},
{"loboda": " You saw this?"},
{"jon": " No. But I trust the man."},
{"karsi": " There are old stories about Dragonglass."},
{"loboda": " There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds."},
{"karsi": " And with the things we\u2019ve seen you don\u2019t believe them?"},
{"jon": " Come with me and I'll share these weapons."},
{"karsi": " Come with you where?"},
{"jon": " There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands."},
{"jon": " I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night\u2019s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We\u2019re prepared to give you that new life."},
{"karsi": " If\u2026?"},
{"jon": " If you swear you join us when the real war begins."},
{"loboda": " Where is Mance?"},
{"jon": " He died."},
{"loboda": " How?"},
{"jon": " I put an arrow through his heart."},
{"loboda": " I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes."},
{"karsi": " I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."},
{"jon": " I\u2019m not asking you to forget your dead. I\u2019ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I\u2019m asking you to think about your children now. They\u2019ll never have children of their own if we don\u2019t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can\u2019t stop them. The Night\u2019s Watch can\u2019t stop them. And all the southern kings can\u2019t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we\u2019ll give the fuckers a fight."},
{"karsi": " You vouch for this man, Tormund?"},
{"tormund": " He\u2019s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He\u2019s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn\u2019t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."},
{"loboda": " My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow."},
{"karsi": " So would mine, but fuck 'em, they\u2019re dead."},
{"tormund": " This is the way."},
{"wildling elder": " I\u2019m with Tormund. We stay here we\u2019re dead men. At least with King Crow there\u2019s a chance."},
{"giant": " Tormund."},
{"loboda": " Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they\u2019re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That\u2019s our enemy. That has always been our enemy."},
{"karsi": " I fucking hate Thenns."},
{"jon": " How many are with us? 5000?"},
{"tormund": " I\u2019m not good at counting."},
{"jon": " We\u2019re leaving too many behind."},
{"tormund": " The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years."},
{"jon": " And he knew them better than I ever will."},
{"tormund": " They\u2019re running out of food and there\u2019s nothing to hunt. They\u2019ll come around."},

{"sam": " His name was Aemon Targaryen. He came to us from King\u2019s Landing, a Maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn. And a sworn brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, ever faithful. No man was wiser or gentler or kinder. At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service, but he was always there to counsel them. He was the blood of the dragon, but now his fire has gone out. And now his watch has ended."},

He\u2019s hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army. But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners. Our people are used to fighting in frost. His army\u2019s out there now, suffering in the snow. One day I\u2019ll be Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North. You\u2019ll be my Lady and Wardeness."},

{"myrcella": " It\u2019s not complicated at all, it\u2019s simple. I love Trystane, I\u2019m going to marry him, and we\u2019re staying right here."},
{"jaime": " I don\u2019t understand."},
{"myrcella": " Of course you don\u2019t! You don\u2019t know me!"},
{"bronn": " Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman\u2019s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I\u2019ve tasted the Dornishman\u2019s wife! Yes I\u2019ve tasted the Dornishman\u2019s wife!"},
{"tyene": " He\u2019s got a good voice."},
{"obara": " We\u2019re lucky he\u2019s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble."},
{"bronn": " It\u2019s against my code to hurt a woman."},
{"obara": " It\u2019s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code."},
{"bronn": " I wouldn\u2019t say you beat me."},
{"tyene": " How\u2019s your arm?"},
{"bronn": " Wonderful. Wouldn\u2019t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar."},
{"tyene": " You think you\u2019re leaving Dorne?"},
{"bronn": " No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world."},
{"tyene": " Thank you."},
{"bronn": " I said Dornish women. I didn\u2019t say you."},
{"tyene": " I\u2019m not the most beautiful woman you\u2019ve ever seen?"},
{"bronn": " I\u2019ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms."},
{"tyene": " Name one more beautiful than I am."},
{"bronn": " Well now, in King\u2019s Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous..."},
{"tyene": " There was a what? In King\u2019s Landing you were saying."},
{"bronn": " Was I?"},
{"tyene": " There was a woman more beautiful than I am."},
{"bronn": " Was there? My memory\u2019s not what it was earlier."},
{"tyene": " How\u2019s your arm now?"},
{"bronn": " You seem concerned with it. You must really like me."},
{"tyene": " And how about your head?"},
{"bronn": " My head\u2026 You don\u2019t even wanna know what\u2019s going on in\u2026"},
{"tyene": " Your nose is bleeding."},
{"bronn": " It\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s the dry air."},
{"tyene": " My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."},
{"tyene": " The only antidote. Who\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world?"},
{"tyene": " Sorry? Who?"},
{"bronn": " You."},
{"tyene": " Don\u2019t drop it."},
{"tyene": " I think you\u2019re very handsome as well."},
{"baelish": " I\u2019m sorry about the locale."},
{"olenna": " No you\u2019re not."},
{"baelish": " It felt like the safest place."},
{"olenna": " Not for your clientele, clearly."},
{"baelish": " It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn\u2019t exist until we invented them."},
{"olenna": " You\u2019ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven\u2019t you?"},
{"baelish": " The past is the past. The future is all that\u2019s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell."},
{"olenna": " Don\u2019t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you\u2019d return to the capital once things started going wrong."},
{"baelish": " I promise you.."},
{"olenna": " I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they\u2019ll never even find what\u2019s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"},
{"baelish": " Cersei summoned me to King\u2019s Landing. I dared not refuse her."},
{"olenna": " And what did she want?"},
{"baelish": " A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."},
{"olenna": " What kind of gift?"},
{"baelish": " The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man."},
{"slave owner": " Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games. When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station. But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen. So whatever happens, the gods have smiled upon you today. Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something."},
{"owner": " You and you, you, you two, you, you, and you."},
{"owner": " Valar morghulis."},
{"men": " Valar dohaeris."},
{"owner": " Prepare yourselves."},
{"daenerys": " Sitting through the great games will be bad enough."},
{"hizdahr": " For generations, in the days leading up to the great games, it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence."},
{"owner": " Move yourselves!"},
{"owner": " Your Grace. Your Future Grace. You honor us all."},
{"owner": " \u201cWe fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.\u201d"},
{"men": " \u201cWe fight and die for your glory, O glorious queen.\u201d"},
{"daenerys": " I think I\u2019ve seen enough."},
{"hizdahr": " Your Grace, it\u2019s a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged."},
{"daenerys": " I\u2019ve sacrificed more than enough for your traditions."},
{"tyrion": " What are you doing?"},
{"daenerys": " Get him out of my sight."},
{"jorah": " Khaleesi, please, I just need a moment of your time. I brought you a gift."},
{"tyrion": " It\u2019s true. He has."},
{"daenerys": " Who are you?"},
{"tyrion": " I am the gift. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Your Grace. My name is Tyrion Lannister."},
{"cersei": " This is horrible. Unacceptable. Are they feeding you enough at least? I brought you this. Venison. It\u2019s quite good. I had it myself for supper only last night. We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."},
{"margaery": " I know you did this."},
{"cersei": " We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods."},
{"margaery": " Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You\u2019re not very good at those, I\u2019m afraid. Perhaps that\u2019s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."},
{"cersei": " You\u2019re upset. You\u2019re not thinking clearly. I\u2019ll visit again when you\u2019ve had a chance to calm down."},
{"margaery": " I don\u2019t want to see you again."},
{"cersei": " I do hope you change your mind about that. I\u2019ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."},
{"margaery": " Leave."},
{"cersei": " Yes, I\u2019m afraid I must. My son needs me now more than ever."},
{"margaery": " Get out you hateful bitch!"},
{"cersei": " Sleep well, sister."},
{"high sparrow": " Thank you.  You saw her?"},
{"cersei": " Yes."},
{"sparrow": " And?"},
{"cersei": " Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?"},
{"sparrow": " Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith."},
{"cersei": " Who will stand judge?"},
{"sparrow": " Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens."},
{"cersei": " Will you be one of them?"},
{"sparrow": " I will."},
{"cersei": " If one or both of them were to confess before the trial\u2026"},
{"sparrow": " Then they will be at The Mother\u2019s mercy."},
{"cersei": " What does The Mother\u2019s mercy entail?"},
{"sparrow": " It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."},
{"cersei": " Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven."},
{"sparrow": " Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King\u2019s Landing?"},
{"cersei": " I think I may have heard at one point."},
{"sparrow": " Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him."},
{"sparrow": " Who carved this altar do you know?"},
{"cersei": " I\u2019m afraid i don\u2019t."},
{"sparrow": " No one does. There\u2019s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn\u2019t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean."},
{"sparrow": " A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."},
{"sparrow": " And he has much to say about you."},
{"cersei": " Move. Let me go immediately."},
{"cersei": " You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy\u2026 I am the queen! Let me go!"},
{"cersei": " Look at me. Look at my face. It\u2019s the last thing you\u2019ll see before you die."},
{"arya": " What are they doing with the bodies?"},
{"waif": " Get back to work."},
{"arya": " No! I\u2019ve been here for weeks. I\u2019m not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why I\u2019m doing it."},
{"waif": " You will know why."},
{"arya": " When?"},
{"waif": " When it\u2019s time. Not before. Get back to work."},
{"arya": " When do I get to play the game?"},
{"waif": " Game?"},
{"arya": " The game. The game of faces."},
{"waif": " You tried already. You failed."},
{"arya": " I didn\u2019t even know I was playing."},
{"waif": " Who are you?"},
{"arya": " No one."},
{"waif": " Get back to work."},
{"arya": " Well who are you? What are you doing here? How\u2019d you get here?"},
{"waif": " I\u2019m from Westeros. Just like you. Daughter of a Lord. Just like you. Except I was an only child. Heir to his fortune. My mother died. My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn\u2019t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I\u2019ve been serving them ever since."},
{"waif": " Was that true or a lie?"},
{"arya": " What?"},
{"waif": " Did you believe every word I said?"},
{"waif": " Get back to work."},
{"jaqen": " Who are you?"},
{"jaqen": " Who are you?"},
{"arya": " Arya."},
{"jaqen": " And where did you come from?"},
{"arya": " Westeros. My family home is Winterfell. I\u2019m the youngest daughter of a great lord. Eddard Stark. He died in battle."},
{"jaqen": " A lie."},
{"arya": " After he was executed I fled the capital. Had to kill a stable boy. Drove my sword through his back."},
{"jaqen": " A lie."},
{"arya": " I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver."},
{"jaqen": " A lie."},
{"arya": " A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn\u2019t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."},
{"arya": " I hated him."},
{"arya": " I hated him!"},
{"arya": " That\u2019s not a lie!"},
{"jaqen": " The girl lies. To me. To the Many Faced God. To herself. Does she truly want to be no one?"},
{"arya": " Yes."},
{"arya": " I\u2019m not playing this stupid game anymore!"},
{"jaqen": " We never stop playing."},
{"tyrion": " So, those villages we were supposed to find. We can\u2019t live on berries and roots."},
{"jorah": " I can."},
{"tyrion": " You\u2019re not hungry?"},
{"jorah": " Of course I\u2019m hungry."},
{"tyrion": " You\u2019re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."},
{"jorah": " I am not your travelling companion."},
{"tyrion": " We are travelling together. In each other\u2019s company. Therefore\u2026"},
{"jorah": " Do you ever shut up?"},
{"tyrion": " I sailed from King\u2019s Landing to Pentos in a crate. Without ever saying a word."},
{"jorah": " Why?"},
{"tyrion": " Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis."},
{"jorah": " I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve visited many brothels in many cities."},
{"tyrion": " I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn\u2019t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved."},
{"tyrion": " As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."},
{"jorah": " What do you know about my father?"},
{"tyrion": " I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? \u201cWe shall never see his like again.\u201d"},
{"tyrion": " You didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. I am."},
{"jorah": " How?"},
{"tyrion": " I only know what I heard"},
{"jorah": " How?"},
{"tyrion": " He was leading an expedition beyond the wall. There was a mutiny. He was murdered by his own men."},
{"jorah": " We better keep moving."},
{"man": " Valar morghulis."},
{"arya": " Valar dohaeris."},
{"man": " I have nowhere else to go. I\u2019ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I\u2019ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end."},
{"girl": " It hurts."},
{"arya": " I know. Don\u2019t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."},
{"arya": " I\u2019ve devoted my life to him now. You don\u2019t want to hurt anymore. Drink."},
{"jaqen": " Is the girl ready to give up her ears, her nose, her tongue, her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates, all that makes a girl who she is, forever?"},
{"jaqen": " No. The girl is not ready to become no one. But she is ready to become someone else."},
{"tyrion": " Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this? As I recall, the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Robert\u2019s Rebellion."},
{"jorah": " Do you believe in anything?"},
{"tyrion": " I believe in many things."},
{"jorah": " In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"},
{"tyrion": " No."},
{"jorah": " Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I\u2019d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"},
{"tyrion": " No."},
{"jorah": " It's hard to be a cynic after that."},
{"tyrion": " Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be a great queen."},
{"jorah": " No it doesn\u2019t."},
{"tyrion": " The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"},
{"jorah": " First we have to conquer the world."},
{"tyrion": " We? Alright, let\u2019s assume your dreams come true. She\u2019s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"},
{"jorah": " Then she rules."},
{"tyrion": " So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That\u2019s justice?"},
{"jorah": " She is the rightful heir."},
{"tyrion": " Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"},
{"jorah": " Shh! It\u2019s a slave ship"},
{"tyrion": " Why is it anchored?"},
{"jorah": " They probably came ashore for--"},
{"malko": " --water."},
{"malko": " Got a lot of fight in you, huh?"},
{"slaver": " Salt mines."},
{"malko": " That or a galley slave. He looks strong enough."},
{"slaver": " What about the dwarf?"},
{"malko": " Worthless. Cut his throat."},
{"tyrion": " Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, let\u2019s discuss this!"},
{"malko": " And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf\u2019s cock has magic powers."},
{"tyrion": " Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can\u2019t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"},
{"slaver": " It will be a dwarf-sized cock."},
{"tyrion": " Guess again."},
{"malko": " The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant."},
{"jorah": " Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery."},
{"malko": " We\u2019re bound to Volantis, not Slaver\u2019s Bay. Besides, she reopened the fighting pits. I never heard of free men fighting in the pits."},
{"tyrion": " The fighting puts in Mereen! You\u2019re in luck then, you\u2019re about to be rich. You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms."},
{"tyrion": "  Him."},
{"malko": " Him? He\u2019s got to be 60 years old."},
{"tyrion": " Sure, he\u2019s a bit long in the tooth, a bit withered, been in the sun too long. We can all see that. But he is a veteran of 100 battles. They wrote songs about him!"},
{"malko": " Is that true?"},
{"tyrion": " He won the tournament at Lannisport, unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself."},
{"tyrion": " The Kingslayer!"},
{"malko": " Jousting. You\u2019re talking about jousting. A fancy game for fancy lads. The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole."},
{"jorah": " I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat."},
{"malko": " Liar."},
{"jorah": " It\u2019s no lie. His name was Qotho. He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo. Take me to Slaver\u2019s Bay, put a sword in my hand, I\u2019ll prove my worth."},
{"lancel": " Lord Baelish."},
{"baelish": " Yes?  Lancel Lannister."},
{"lancel": " Brother Lancel. We abandoned our family names."},
{"baelish": " That\u2019s quite a family to abandon."},
{"lancel": " The city has changed since you were here last. We flooded the gutters with wine, smashed the false idols, and sent the godless on the run."},
{"baelish": " Well done."},
{"baelish": " I\u2019m here on urgent business for the Queen Mother. Should I send word that I\u2019ll be delayed?"},
{"lancel": " Step carefully, Lord Baelish. You\u2019ll find that there\u2019s little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new King\u2019s Landing."},
{"baelish": " We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel. Mine just happen to be entertaining."},
{"baelish": " Do you think it\u2019s wise, your Grace, arresting the heir to Highgarden?"},
{"cersei": " The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden."},
{"baelish": " Of course. And the Faith were armed on your orders."},
{"cersei": " The King\u2019s orders. Is the King to blame for Ser Loras\u2019 perversion?"},
{"baelish": " House Tyrell won\u2019t tolerate these insults."},
{"cersei": " House Tyrell won\u2019t tolerate it? I\u2019m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."},
{"baelish": " One\u2019s choice of companion is a curious thing."},
{"cersei": " Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you\u2019re still in mourning."},
{"baelish": " Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman."},
{"cersei": " She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."},
{"baelish": " I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age."},
{"cersei": " If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?"},
{"baelish": " Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne."},
{"cersei": " Good.  If there\u2019s nothing else."},
{"baelish": " There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn\u2019t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."},
{"cersei": " That\u2019s not possible."},
{"baelish": " My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."},
{"cersei": " Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father."},
{"baelish": " Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart."},
{"cersei": " We were fools to trust a turncloak."},
{"baelish": " Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house."},
{"cersei": " I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil."},
{"baelish": " I would counsel patience, your grace."},
{"cersei": " Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."},
{"baelish": " Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they\u2019re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."},
{"cersei": " Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."},
{"baelish": " That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."},
{"cersei": " My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse."},
{"baelish": " Ser Jaime, then."},
{"cersei": " Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I\u2019ve no idea when he\u2019ll be back."},
{"baelish": " Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."},
{"cersei": " Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."},
{"baelish": " You wouldn\u2019t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"},
{"cersei": " And if you succeed?"},
{"baelish": " Name me Warden of the North."},
{"cersei": " I\u2019ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree."},
{"baelish": " I\u2019ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell."},
{"cersei": " And I\u2019ll l know you\u2019re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark\u2019s head on a spike."},
{"baelish": " As I said. I live to serve."},
{"trystane": " I\u2019m going to ask him tomorrow."},
{"myrcella": " What if he says no?"},
{"trystane": " He won\u2019t. You\u2019ve waited long enough. I want you to be my wife now. What is it?"},
{"myrcella": " Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it, or do you\u2026"},
{"myrcella": " We can\u2019t. Not yet."},
{"trystane": " Why not?"},
{"myrcella": " You know why not. Someone will see."},
{"trystane": " You are going to be my wife. I am going to be your husband. We are allowed to walk through the gardens together."},
{"myrcella": " How many other girls have you walked through these gardens?"},
{"trystane": " I like the way your eyes go squinty when you\u2019re jealous."},
{"myrcella": " They don\u2019t go squinty, and you didnt answer the question."},
{"doran": " They make a lovely couple. A Lannister and a Martell. They have no idea how dangerous that is. We must protect them."},
{"areo": " Yes, my prince."},
{"doran": " You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time. I hope you remember how."},
{"areo": " I remember how."},
{"bronn": " The Dornishman\u2019s wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring. The Dornishman\u2019s blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing. The Dornishman\u2019s wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach..."},
{"jaime": " Alright, thats enough."},
{"bronn": " I\u2019m coming to the best part."},
{"jaime": " We\u2019re trying to blend in. We don\u2019t want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent."},
{"bronn": " This song really is all about the ending."},
{"jaime": " It can wait. Up there."},
{"jaime": " That\u2019s the Water Gardens."},
{"bronn": " Once we got the princess, then what?"},
{"jaime": " I like to improvise."},
{"bronn": " That explains the golden hand."},
{"ellaria": " Unbowed, unbent, unbroken. For Oberyn."},
{"sand snakes": " For Oberyn."},
{"bronn": " Well, she\u2019s made herself at home."},

{"olenna": " Rumors and gossip, that\u2019s all they got. It\u2019s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King\u2019s Landing there\u2019d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."},

{"olenna": " Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared."},

{"cersei": " As I said, i didn\u2019t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"},
{"olenna": " What veil?"},
{"cersei": " The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?"},
{"olenna": " I didn\u2019t trust your father. I didn\u2019t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them."},
{"cersei": " House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we\u2019ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."},

{"loras": " Why does it matter what I wore?"},
{"sparrow": " Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."},

{"sparrow": " You never lay with Renly Baratheon."},
{"loras": " Never."},
{"sparrow": " Nor any other man."},
{"loras": " Never."},
{"sparrow": " That will be all Ser Loras."},

{"margaery": " You call me forward?"},
{"sparrow": " Yes. We have some questions for you."},
{"margaery": " I am the queen."},

{"margaery": " All of them."},

{"sparrow": " Thank you, your grace."},
{"sparrow": " Do you know this man?"},
{"olyvar": " Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."},
{"sparrow": " How did you come to meet?"},
{"olyvar": " I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met."},
{"sparrow": " And what occurred in his chamber?"},
{"olyvar": " We engaged in intimate relations."},
{"sparrow": " You laid with him?"},
{"olyvar": " That night and many others."},
{"loras": " Liar! He\u2019s a liar!"},
{"sparrow": " Is there anyone else who can support your claim?"},
{"olyvar": " Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn\u2019t seem surprised."},
{"cersei": " This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?"},
{"olyvar": " He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."},
{"loras": " Liar!"},
{"olenna": " What are you doing? Let us pass."},
{"sparrow": " The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery."},
{"margaery": " What?"},
{"sparrow": " Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her."},

Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don\u2019t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."},

{"sansa": " Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."},
{"ramsay": " You\u2019re not lying to me?"},
{"sansa": " No, my lord."},
{"ramsay": " Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don\u2019t you think?"},

{"tyrion": " Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?"},
{"jaime": " Soon."},
{"tyrion": " Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"},
{"jaime": " I've never seen him fight."},
{"tyrion": " Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."},
{"jaime": " Oberyn believes in himself."},
{"tyrion": " That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?"},
{"jaime": " Beheading."},
{"tyrion": " Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."},
{"jaime": " Cousins."},
{"tyrion": " Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"},
{"jaime": " Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple."},
{"tyrion": " Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock."},
{"together": " Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"},
{"tyrion": " Nothing made him happier."},
{"jaime": " Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted."},

{"jaime": " The joke wore thin, though."},
{"tyrion": " For you. You drifted away."},
{"jaime": " I had other interests."},
{"tyrion": " Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."},
{"jaime": " Why?"},
{"tyrion": " I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. \"Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?\" He gave me an answer. \"Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!\" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."},
{"jaime": " Volarik. Tried to touch me once."},
{"tyrion": " Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of \"khuu, khuu, khuu\". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard \"khuu, khuu, khuu\" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."},
{"jaime": " Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"},
{"tyrion": " I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."},
{"jaime": " He was twice your size."},
{"tyrion": " He just pushed me aside with a \"khuu\" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"},
{"jaime": " I don't know."},

{"jaime": " You fell in love with a whore."},
{"tyrion": " Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."},
{"jaime": " Careful. I'm the last friend you've got."},
{"tyrion": " At least I got to tell them what they really are."},
{"jaime": " Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."},
{"tyrion": " Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."},
{"jaime": " I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand."},

{"tyrion": " Is it two wives you want or two castles?"},
{"bronn": " One of each will do. But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you, it'd better be a damn big castle."},
{"tyrion": " I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude."},
{"bronn": " I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?"},
{"tyrion": " You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts."},
{"bronn": " Your sister's a Lannister, too."},
{"tyrion": " My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."},
{"bronn": " If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."},
{"tyrion": " Does he frighten you so much?"},
{"bronn": " I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... ...and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"},

{"selyse": " If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"},
{"melisandre": " Not always."},
{"melisandre": " Most of these powders and potions are lies. Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lord's power. Once they step into his light, they will see the lie for what it was-- a trick that lead them to the truth. A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky. And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear. And a drop of this in any man's wine will drive him wild with lust."},
{"selyse": " Did you use it with Stannis?"},
{"melisandre": " No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have."},
{"melisandre": " It's only flesh. It needs what it needs."},
{"selyse": " No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."},
{"melisandre": " I understand how you feel."},
{"selyse": " Hmm."},
{"melisandre": " But that is impossible."},
{"selyse": " Why?"},
{"melisandre": " You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself."},

{"jorah": " Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?"},

{"jorah": " Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."},
{"daenerys": " And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?"},
{"jorah": " It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."},

Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy.

{"brienne": " The quick version."},
{"hot pie": " The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly."},

{"podrick": " They'll take her to the Eyrie, my lady."},
{"brienne": " Why the Eyrie?"},
{"podrick": " Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."},
{"brienne": " Sansa could be there, too."},
{"podrick": " Aye, my lady. Could be."},
{"brienne": "  You sure about this?"},
{"podrick": " No."},

{"tyrion": " Mm, do tell. I've got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like."},
{"oberyn": " Your sister."},
{"tyrion": " Oh."},
{"oberyn": "  Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself."},
{"tyrion": " Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts."},
{"oberyn": " It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed."},
{"tyrion": " She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time."},
{"oberyn": " Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."},
{"tyrion": " I think I would have remembered that."},
{"oberyn": " Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."},
{"tyrion": " You and my family have more in common than you might admit."},
{"oberyn": " The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."},
{"tyrion": " That would have made things so much easier."},
{"oberyn": " When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, \"Soon.\" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. \"That's not a monster,\" I told Cersei. \"That's just a baby.\" And she said, \"He killed my mother.\" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. \"It doesn't matter,\" she told us. \"Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long.\""},
{"tyrion": " Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."},
{"oberyn": " And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children."},
{"tyrion": " If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."},
{"oberyn": " I disagree."},
{"oberyn": " I've come to the perfect place. I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice. And all those who have wronged me are right here. I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane, who killed my sister's children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her, too. I will be your champion."},

{"sansa": " It's a long story."},
{"robin": " I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person."},
{"sansa": " Yes, you certainly are."},
{"robin": " When will you go back?"},
{"sansa": " Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down."},
{"robin": " Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?"},
{"sansa": " No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."},
{"robin": " That sounds dangerous. How do you make people fly?"},
{"sansa": " We don't."},
{"robin": " What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?"},
{"sansa": " I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from."},
{"robin": " Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."},
{"sansa": " I like the sound of that."},
{"robin": " Let's put a Moon Door in your Winterfell."},
{"sansa": " All right."},

He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"},
{"sansa": " No."},

{"sansa": " No, never."},

{"sansa": " I'm a virgin, I swear it. He loves you, Aunt Lysa. All he says is that I'm stupid. I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and I'm a terrible liar, so I should always tell the truth. And I swear to you that he has never touched me. Not once, not ever."},
{"lysa": "  Shh. Shh. Shh. It's all right. It will all be all right. You'll be a widow soon. They'll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and you'll be free to marry Robin. You'll be the Lady of the Vale. Hmm."},

{"sansa": " Well, there was Ser Dontos. You used him to get me out of King's Landing, but you would never trust him to kill the king."},
{"littlefinger": " Why not?"},
{"sansa": " Because you're too smart to trust a drunk."},

{"sansa": " No."},
{"littlefinger": " How do you know?"},
{"sansa": " I just do."},

{"littlefinger": " A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."},
{"sansa": " I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"},
{"littlefinger": " So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want."},
{"sansa": " And what do you want?"},
{"littlefinger": " Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"},
{"sansa": " Who could trust you?"},
{"littlefinger": " I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."},

Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."},

{"margaery": " "},
{"olenna": " And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."},

Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."},

{"brienne": " Of course."},
{"jaime": " The Mad King was obsessed with it. He loved to watch people burn, the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones. He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city-- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.' Tell me, if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men, women, and children burned alive, would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?"},
{"jaime": " First, I killed the pyromancer. And then when the king turned to flee, I drove my sword into his back. 'Burn them all,' he kept saying. 'Burn them all.' I don't think he expected to die. He-- he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again, reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn't happen. That's where Ned Stark found me."},
{"brienne": " If this is true why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell Lord Stark?"},
{"jaime": " Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?"},

I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."},

{"varys": " But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."},

Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."},

The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies.

{"craster": " I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."},
{"craster": " Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt.  And she's almost as fat as this one here.  Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."},

{"stannis": "  Then serve me."},
{"melisandre": " When I return, you will understand."},
{"stannis": " My enemies think they've destroyed me. They're laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me. I want Joffrey dead. I want Robb Stark dead. Make me another son."},
{"melisandre": " I cannot."},
{"stannis": " Why?"},
{"melisandre": " You don't have the strength. It would kill you."},
{"stannis": " I'm not so easily killed. Men have been trying for years."},

{"melisandre": " There is another way. A better way."},

{"melisandre": "  Yes."},
{"stannis": "  I'm the one true king."},
{"melisandre": " You are. But there are others with your blood in their veins. You will sit on the Iron Throne, but first there must be sacrifices. The Lord of Light demands it."},

{"daenerys": " Give me your water."},
{"jorah": " Khaleesi, this man has been sentenced to death."},

{"barristan": " Leave this place, Your Grace. Leave tonight, I beg you."},
{"jorah": " And what is she to do for soldiers?"},
{"barristan": " We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr."},
{"jorah": " Is it 'we' already, Ser Barristan? If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built, you must win it. That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done."},
{"daenerys": " The blood of my enemies, not the blood of innocents."},
{"jorah": " How many wars have you fought in, Ser Barristan?"},
{"barristan": " Three."},
{"jorah": "  Have you ever seen a war where innocents didn't die by the thousands?"},
{"barristan": " "},
{"jorah": " I was in King's Landing after the sack, khaleesi. You know what I saw? Butchery. Babies, children, old men. More women raped than you can count. There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."},
{"daenerys": " Do you disagree, Ser Barristan?"},
{"barristan": " When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident, men died for him because they believed in him, because they loved him, not because they'd been bought at a slaver's auction. I fought beside the last dragon on that day, Your Grace. I bled beside him."},
{"jorah": " Rhaegar fought valiantly, Rhaegar fought nobly, and Rhaegar died."},
{"daenerys": " Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?"},
{"barristan": " I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."},
{"daenerys": " I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon."},

{"daenerys": " They did not. I want to buy them all."},
{"missandei": "  She wants to buy them all."},
{"kraznys": "  She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."},
{"missandei": " There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?"},
{"daenerys": " Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well."},
{"greizhen": "  If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor."},
{"missandei": " Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."},
{"daenerys": " I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop."},
{"kraznys": "  The slut cannot pay for all of this."},
{"missandei": " Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this."},
{"kraznys": "  Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more."},
{"missandei": " Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous."},
{"kraznys": "  And this is because I like the curve of her ass."},
{"missandei": " The gold you have left is worth 10."},
{"kraznys": "  What is left will buy her 10. I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering."},
{"missandei": " But good Master Kraznys will give you 20."},
{"kraznys": "  Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed."},
{"missandei": " The Dothraki you have with you--"},
{"kraznys": "  I will give her 3 for those."},
{"missandei": "  The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."},
{"kraznys": "  So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"},
{"missandei": " Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."},
{"daenerys": "  I have dragons. I'll give you one."},
{"missandei": " "},
{"barristan": " You will win the throne with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace."},

{"daenerys": " One."},
{"kraznys": " "},
{"missandei": " They want the biggest one."},
{"daenerys": "  Done."},
{"kraznys": "  Done."},
{"daenerys": " I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."},
{"missandei": "  She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."},
{"cut to": " outside the courtyard."},
{"jorah": " Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."},
{"barristan": " Aegon Targaryen proved that."},
{"daenerys": " You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"},
{"daenerys": " Do you have a name?"},
{"missandei": " This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."},
{"daenerys": " Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?"},
{"missandei": " No, Your Grace. No family living."},
{"daenerys": " You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth."},
{"missandei": " Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."},
{"daenerys": " I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'"},
{"missandei": " There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."},
{"daenerys": " Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?"},
{"missandei": " All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."},
{"daenerys": " And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed."},
{"missandei": " Valar morghulis."},
{"daenerys": " Yes, all men must die. But we are not men."},
{"int": " Littlefinger's brothel."},

{"ros": " That's all of them, my lord."},

{"podrick": "  Yes, my lord."},
{"littlefinger": " I hear you owe that boy a significant debt."},
{"tyrion": " Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."},
{"littlefinger": " You should have him knighted."},
{"tyrion": " If only the Master of Coin had such power."},
{"littlefinger": " If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her."},
{"tyrion": " Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."},
{"littlefinger": " Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."},
{"tyrion": " We don't. I did fuck her once."},
{"littlefinger": "  I know."},
{"tyrion": "  But we don't."},
{"littlefinger": " I know. But how would the queen get that idea?"},
{"tyrion": " Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?"},
{"littlefinger": " Keep a low profile."},
{"tyrion": " If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."},
{"littlefinger": " Well, you are richer than I am."},
{"tyrion": " Good point."},
{"littlefinger": " They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."},
{"tyrion": " I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."},
{"cut to": " The hallway outside Littlefinger's chambers."},
{"bronn": " Come on, I'm here later. Come on."},
{"bronn": " Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."},
{"tyrion": " You think all reading is dull reading."},
{"bronn": " It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know."},
{"tyrion": " The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages."},
{"bronn": " Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to."},
{"tyrion": " Unless he made it all up, yes.  Podrick, do keep up."},
{"podrick": "  Yes, my lord."},
{"tyrion": "  Podrick."},
{"podrick": "  Yes, my lord?"},
{"tyrion": " After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"},
{"podrick": " No, my lord."},
{"tyrion": "  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers."},
{"bronn": " She's not bad with second-timers, either."},
{"podrick": " Uh, my lord"},
{"tyrion": " A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"},
{"tyrion": " Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."},
{"marei": " He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome."},
{"tyrion": " Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot."},
{"podrick": " My lord, I don't even"},
{"tyrion": "  She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord."},
{"tyrion": " Be back in time for my supper."},
{"bronn": " Pace yourself, lad."},
{"tyrion": " For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."},
{"bronn": " Let me guess. He's not a magician."},
{"tyrion": " No."},
{"bronn": "  He's stealing it?"},
{"tyrion": " Worse, he's borrowing it."},
{"bronn": " What's wrong with that?"},
{"tyrion": " We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."},
{"bronn": " Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."},
{"tyrion": " Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."},
{"bronn": " I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules."},
{"tyrion": " Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."},
{"bronn": " And what if I don't?"},
{"tyrion": " Well, you have to."},
{"bronn": " But what if I don't?"},
{"tyrion": " This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."},
{"tyrion": " Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"},
{"bronn": " The lad's practically skipping."},
{"tyrion": " You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?"},
{"tyrion": " Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."},
{"bronn": " He's a squire. You don't pay him."},
{"tyrion": " Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."},
{"podrick": " They wouldn't take it, my lord."},
{"bronn": " Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin."},
{"tyrion": " Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them."},
{"bronn": " What did you tell them?"},
{"podrick": " I didn't tell them anything."},
{"tyrion": "  What did you do to them?"},
{"podrick": " Lots of things."},
{"tyrion": " And they seemed to like these things?"},
{"podrick": " Yes, my lord."},
{"bronn": " Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it."},
{"tyrion": " Only they weren't paid."},
{"bronn": " What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"},
{"tyrion": " Is that what you're telling us?  {PODRICK doesn't deny it."},

{"jaime": " You know who she is, don't you?"},
{"locke": " A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big."},
{"jaime": " She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?"},
{"man": " I'm gonna cut your throat!"},
{"jaime": " They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones."},

{"brienne": " "},
{"locke": " Your father, he'd pay your weight in gold to get you back?"},
{"jaime": " You'll be a rich man till the end of your days. And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them. Lands, titles-- you'll have them all. The North can't win this war. You're a smart man. You understand that. We have the numbers. We have the gold."},

{"locke": " Hard to argue with that."},
{"jaime": " Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."},
